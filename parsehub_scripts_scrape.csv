PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban
high school in Portland, Oregon. Smarties, Skids, Preppies,
Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep
out of their eyes and head for the main building.
PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be
-- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of
coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered,
baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and
spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees
who his board has hit.
RIDER
Hey -- sorry.
Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered
belongings.
KAT
Leave it
He persists.
KAT (continuing)
I said, leave it!
She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a
car, skateboard tip to his throat. He whimpers pitifully
and she lets him go. A path clears for her as she marches
through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door,
entering school.
INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the
mirror, applying lipstick. Her less extraordinary, but
still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.
BIANCA
Did you change your hair?
CHASTITY
No.
BIANCA
You might wanna think about it
Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both
boys
and girls alike.
BOY
(adoring)
Hey, Bianca.
GIRL
Awesome shoes.
The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and
unaddressed by her side. Bianca smiles proudly,
acknowledging her fans.
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open,
farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery
guidance counselor.
MISS PERKY
I'm sure you won't find Padua any
different than your old school. Same
little asswipe mother-fuckers
everywhere.
Her plastic smile never leaves her face. Cameron fidgets in
his chair uncomfortably.
MISS PERKY
(continuing)
Any questions?
CAMERON
I don't think so, ma'am
MISS PERKY
Then go forth. Scoot I've got
deviants to see.
Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK
VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms
Perky's door. His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he
is.
Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
MISS PERKY
(continuing)
Patrick Verona. I see we're making our
visits a weekly ritual.
She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming
smile.
PATRICK
I missed you.
MISS PERKY
It says here you exposed yourself to a
group of freshmen girls.
PATRICK
It was a bratwurst. I was eating
lunch.
MISS PERKY
With the teeth of your zipper?
She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron
shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky,
brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game
show host.
MICHAEL
You the new guy?
CAMERON
So they tell me...
MICHAEL
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the
tour.
They head out of the office
MICHAEL
(continuing)
So -- which Dakota you from?
CAMERON
North, actually. How'd you ?
MICHAEL
I was kidding. People actually live
there?
CAMERON
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by
the cows, though.
MICHAEL
How many people were in your old
school?
CAMERON
Thirty-two.
MICHAEL
Get out!
CAMERON
How many people go here?
MICHAEL
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
INT. HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through
the crowd as he points to various cliques.
MICHAEL
We've got your basic beautiful people.
Unless they talk to you first, don't
bother.
The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader
splendor.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Those 're your cowboys.
Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys
walk by.
CAMERON
That I'm used to.
MICHAEL
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a
horse. They just jack off to Clint
Eastwood.
They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled
around it.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.
Very edgy. Don't make any sudden
movements around them.
EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
Michael continues the tour
MICHAEL
And these delusionals are the White
Rastae.
Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets
lounge on the grass. A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Big Marley fans. Think they're black.
Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a
lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I
mean.
Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?
DEREK
(very stoned)
Michael, my brother, peace
Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the
cafeteria.
CAMERON
So where do you fit in all this?
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Loud music and loud students. Michael sits with a group of
studious-looking teens.
MICHAEL
Future MBAs- We're all Ivy League,
already accepted. Someday I'll be
sipping Merlot while those guys --
He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various
passers-by.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
are fixing my Saab. Yuppie greed is
back, my friend.
He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.
Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO
MO. Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael
without a look.
Cameron is smitten
CAMERON
That girl -- I --
MICHAEL
You burn, you pine, you perish?
CAMERON
Who is she?
MICHAEL
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't
even think about it
CAMERON
Why not?
MICHAEL
I could start with your haircut, but it
doesn't matter. She's not allowed to
date until her older sister does. And
that's an impossibility.
ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space
MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English
Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.
MRS. BLAISE
Well, then. Oh, yes. I guess that
does it for our analysis of The Old Man
and the Sea. Any other comments?
(with dread)
Kat?
Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes
off her glasses and speaks up.
KAT
Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?
MRS. BLAISE
I'm sorry?
KAT
This book is about a guy and his
fishing habit. Not exactly a crucial
topic.
The other students roll their eyes.
KAT
(continuing)
Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still
revere Hemingway. He was an abusive,
alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of
cats.
JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones,
makes fun of her from his row.
JOEY
As opposed to a bitter self-righteous
hag who has no friends?
A few giggles. Kat ignores him. A practiced gesture
MRS. BLAISE
That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
Really gets fired up now
KAT
I guess the school board thinks because
Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's
worthy of our time
She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her
pill box.
KAT
(continuing)
What about Colette? Charlotte Bronte?
Simone de Beauvoir?
Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a
crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY,
embroidered on his workshirt.
PATRICK
Mother Goose?
The class titters. Kat wears an expression of intolerance
INT. GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
Kat now sits before Miss Perky.
MISS PERKY
Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've
been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
KAT
Expressing my opinion is not a
terrorist action.
MISS PERKY
Well, yes, compared to your other
choices of expression this year, today's
events are quite mild. By the way,
Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation
went quite well, in case you're
interested.
KAT
I still maintain that he kicked himself
in the balls. I was merely a spectator.
MISS PERKY
The point is Kat -- people perceive you
as somewhat ...
Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.
KAT
Tempestuous?
MISS PERKY
No ... I believe ""heinous bitch"" is the
term used most often.
She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.
MISS PERKY
(continuing)
You might want to work on that
Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the
counselor's.
KAT
As always, thank you for your excellent
guidance.
INT. SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in
big flowing handwriting.
TEACHER (0.S.)
I realize the language of Mr.
Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting,
but I'm sure you're all doing your best.
Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip
of her hair to CHASTITY. Chastity opens the note and reads:
INSERT - ""JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY
GOD!""
Chastity frowns to herself.
TEACHER (0.S.)
(continuing)
Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment
on what you've read so far?
Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.
BIANCA
Not really.
The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.
MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side
trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her
notebook, looks up and raises her hand.
TEACHER
Mandella -- since you're assisting us,
you might as well comment. I'm assuming
you read the assignment.
MANDELLA
Uh, yeah, I read it all
TEACHER
The whole play^
MANDELIA
The whole folio. All the plays.
TEACHER
(disbelieving)
You've read every play by William
Shakespeare?
MANDELLA
Haven't you?
She raises a challenging eyebrow. The stunned teacher
doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.
EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are
eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
MANDELLA
Your sister is so amazingly without. She'll never read him.
She has no idea.
Kat attacks
KAT
The fact that you're cutting gym so you
can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear
his name, is a little without in itself
if you ask me.
Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his
friends, lighting up a cigarette. Mandella notices her
staring.
MANDELLA
Who's that?
KAT
Patrick Verona Random skid.
MANDELLA
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone
for a year? I heard he was doing porn
movies.
KAT
I'm sure he's completely incapable of
doing anything that interesting.
MANDELLA
He always look so
KAT
Block E?
Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into
Mandella's hand.
KAT
(continuing)
Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a
very slow way to die.
MANDELLA
Just a little.
She eats. Kat sees her wrist
KAT
What's this?
MANDELLA
An attempted slit.
Kat stares at her, expressionless.
KAT
I realize that the men of this fine
institution are severely lacking, but
killing yourself so you can be with
William Shakespeare is beyond the scope
of normal teenage obsessions. You're
venturing far past daytime talk show
fodder and entering the world of those
who need very expensive therapy.
MANDELLA
But imagine the things he'd say during
sex.
Thinks a minute
KAT
Okay, say you do it. You kill
yourself, you end up in wherever you end
up and he's there. Do you really think
he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound
compulsive who failed volleyball?
Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca
ACROSS THE COURTYARD
As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS One of
the cohorts elbows Joey.
COHORT
Virgin alert.
Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
JOEY
Lookin' good, ladies.
Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
MANDELLA
Tragic.
Doesn't respond
ANOTHER ANGLE
Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from
their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can
of beans linger on the grass behind them.
CAMERON
Why do girls like that always like guys
like that?
MICHAEL
Because they're bred to. Their mothers
liked guys like that, and their
grandmothers before them. Their gene
pool is rarely diluted.
CAMERON
He always have that shit-eating grin?
MICHAEL
Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish
I could say he's a moron, but he's
number twelve in the class. And a
model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's
rumored to have a big tube sock ad
coming out.
The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their
empty bean cans. Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries
to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
You know French?
CAMERON
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
MICHAEL
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
CAMERON
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to
her?
MICHAEL
You could consecrate with her, my
friend.
Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car. Joey pulls up
beside her in his Viper.
JOEY
(re her dress)
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't
you been reading your Sassy?
KAT
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of
you featured in your big Kmart spread
was your elbow. Tough break.
JOEY
(practically
spitting)
They're running the rest of me next
month.
He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.
Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in
a convertible.
KAT
The people at this school are so
incredibly foul.
MANDELLA
You could always go with me. I'm sure
William has some friends.
They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and
Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
JOEY
Need a ride, ladies?
Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough. He
pulls away with a smile.
BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
MANDELLA
That's a charming new development
Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the
tape deck. The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his
moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
KAT
(yelling)
Remove head from sphincter! Then
pedal!
Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry
at the delay.
Cameron rushes over
CAMERON
You all right?
He slows to a stop
MICHAEL
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the
shrew.
CAMERON
That's her? Bianca's sister?
MICHAEL
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's
grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint
jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
- as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of
her computer, typing quickly. A shelf next to her holds
several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name.
Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she
types.
KAT
""Undulating with desire, Adrienne
removes her crimson cape, revealing her
creamy --""
WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type
obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a
doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag.
WALTER
I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before
Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.
He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to
kiss Sharon on the cheek.
SHARON
In the microwave.
WALTER
(to Kat)
Make anyone cry today?
KAT
Sadly, no. But it's only four-thirty.
Bianca walks in.
KAT
(continuing)
Where've you been?
BIANCA
(eyeing Walter)
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
She kisses him on the cheek
WALTER
Hello, precious.
Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs
KAT
How touching.
Walter holds up a letter to Kat
WALTER
What's this? It says Sarah Lawrence?
Snatches it away from him.
KAT
I guess I got in
Sharon looks up from her computer.
SHARON
What's a synonym for throbbing?
WALTER
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of
the country.
KAT
I know.
WALTER
I thought we decided you were going to
school here. At U of 0.
KAT
You decided.
BIANCA
Is there even a question that we want
her to stay?
Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at
KAT
Ask Bianca who drove her home
SHARON
Swollen...turgid.
WALTER
(to Bianca; upset)
Who drove you home?
Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
BIANCA
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's
this boy... and I think he might ask...
WALTER
No! You're not dating until your sister
starts dating. End of discussion.
BIANCA
What if she never starts dating?
WALTER
Then neither will you. And I'll get to
sleep at night.
BIANCA
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant,
Daddy!
KAT
This from someone whose diary is
devoted to favorite grooming tips?
WALTER
Enough!
He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
WALTER
(continuing)
Do you know what this is?
He hits the ""play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from
the tape recorder.
BIANCA AND WALTER
(in unison, by
rote)
The sound of a fifteen-year-old in
labor.
WALTER
This is why you're not dating until
your sister does.
BIANCA
But she doesn't want to date.
WALTER
Exactly my point
His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again
WALTER
(continuing)
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich
before you women start dilating?
SHARON
Tumescent!
WALTER
(to Sharon; as he
leaves)
You're not helping.
INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him. Bianca arrives
in a flurry of blonde hair.
BIANCA
Can we make this quick? Roxanne
Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an
incredibly horrendous public break- up
on the quad. Again.
CAMERON
Well, I thought we'd start with
pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
BIANCA
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please.
CAMERON
(looking down)
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some
French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
Bianca smiles slowly
BIANCA
You're asking me out. That's so cute.
What's your name again?
CAMERON
(embarrassed)
Forget it.
Bianca seizes an opportunity.
BIANCA
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have
a proper introduction ---
CAMERON
Cameron.
BIANCA
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the
mercy of a particularly hideous breed of
loser. My sister. I can't date until
she does.
CAMERON
Seems like she could get a date easy
enough...
She fingers a lock of her hair. He looks on, dazzled.
BIANCA
The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
CAMERON
Why?
BIANCA
Unsolved mystery. She used to be
really popular when she started high
school, then it was just like she got
sick of it or something.
CAMERON
That's a shame.
She reaches out and touches his arm
BIANCA
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a
boyfriend...
CAMERON
Let me see what I can do.
Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is
INT. BIOLOGY CLASS
A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.
Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.
MICHAEL
You're in school for one day and you
ask out the most beautiful girl? Do you
have no concept of the high school
social code?
Cameron grins away
CAMERON
I teach her French, get to know her,
dazzle her with charm and she falls in
love with me.
MICHAEL
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't
go out with you. So what's the
point?
Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab
tables away. He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles
as he tries to revive his frog.
CAMERON
What about him?
MICHAEL
(confused)
You wanna go out with him?
The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows
CAMERON
(impatient)
No - he could wrangle with the sister.
Michael smiles. Liking the intrigue.
MICHAEL
What makes you think he'll do it?
CAMERON
He seems like he thrives on danger
MICHAEL
No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard
he lit a state trooper on fire. He just
got out of Alcatraz...
CAMERON
They always let felons sit in on Honors
Biology?
MICHAEL
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He
sold his own liver on the black market
so he could buy new speakers.
CAMERON
Forget his reputation. Do you think
we've got a plan or not?
MICHAEL
Did she actually say she'd go out with
you?
CAMERON
That's what I just said
Michael processes this.
MICHAEL
You know, if you do go out with Bianca,
you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone.
Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
CAMERON
I thought you hated those people.
MICHAEL
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients
when I get to Wall Street.
A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee
Kid's latte. Cameron presses on, over the melee.
CAMERON
So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another
frog, with full-on sound effects.
MICHAEL
I'll let you handle that.
INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood
Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his
jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway. Inside
several bags of coffee hang from hooks.
PEPE
Some people like the Colombian, but it
all depends on your acidity preference.
Me? I prefer East African and
Indonesian. You start the day with a
Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian
Sidamo in your cup, you're that much
farther ahead than someone drinkin'
Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I
mean?
Michael nods solemnly.
ACROSS THE ROOM
Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that
looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.
Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer
CAMERON
Hey, there
In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his
direction.
Cameron slinks away.
CAMERON
(continuing)
Later, then.
Michael watches, shaking his head.
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria
tray with a magic marker.
Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be
MICHAEL
Hey.
JOEY
Are you lost?
MICHAEL
Nope - just came by to chat
JOEY
We don't chat.
MICHAEL
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an
idea by you. You know, just to see if
you're interested.
JOEY
We're not.
He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to
draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker. Michael
suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
MICHAEL
(grimacing)
Hear me out. You want Bianca don't
you?
Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
But she can't go out with you because
her sister is this insane head case and
no one will go out with her. right?
JOEY
Does this conversation have a purpose?
MICHAEL
So what you need to do is recruit a guy
who'll go out with her. Someone who's
up for the job.
Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his
turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage
can, rather than in it.
JOEY
That guy? I heard he ate a live duck once. Everything but
the beak and the feet.
MICHAEL
Exactly
Joey turns to look at Michael.
JOEY
What's in it for you?
MICHAEL
Oh, hey, nothin' man Purely good will
on my part.
He rises to leave and turns to the others.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
I have a dick on my face, don't I?
INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork
off his face as Cameron watches.
CAMERON
You got him involved?
MICHAEL
Like we had a choice? Besides -- when
you let the enemy think he's
orchestrating the battle, you're in a
position of power. We let him pretend
he's calling the shots, and while he's
busy setting up the plan, you have time
to woo Bianca.
Cameron grins and puts an arm around him
CAMERON
You're one brilliant guy
Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.
MICHAEL
Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but
it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who
Embraces Guys In The Bathroom.
Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a
manly way for the others, now watching.
INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai. Mandella is
smoking.
KAT
So he has this huge raging fit about
Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to
his male-dominated, puking frat boy,
number one golf team school. I have no
say at all.
MANDELLA
William would never have gone to a
state school.
KAT
William didn't even go to high school
MANDELLA
That's never been proven
KAT
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Mandella replies with a look of ice. Kat uses the moment to
stub out Mandella's cigarette.
KAT
(continuing)
I appreciate your efforts toward a
speedy death, but I'm consuming.
(pointing at her
food)
Do you mind?
MANDELLA
Does it matter?
KAT
If I was Bianca, it would be, ""Any
school you want, precious. Don't forget
your tiara.""
They both look up as Patrick enters. He walks up to the
counter to place his order.
Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip
MANDELLA
Janice Parker told me he was a roadie
for Marilyn Manson.
Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.
KAT
Janice Parker is an idiot
INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food
MISS PERKY
(looking at chart)
I don't understand, Patrick. You
haven't done anything asinine this week.
Are you not feeling well?
PATRICK
Touch of the flu.
MISS PERKY
I'm at a loss, then. What should we
talk about? Your year of absence?
He smiles his charming smile
PATRICK
How 'bout your sex life?
She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.
MISS PERKY
Why don't we discuss your driving need
to be a hemorrhoid?
PATRICK
What's to discuss?
MISS PERKY
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid,
and as far as I can tell, you're only
slightly psychotic -- so why is it that
you're such a fuck-up?
PATRICK
Well, you know -- there's the prestige
of the job title... and the benefits
package is pretty good...
The bell RINGS.
MISS PERKY
Fine. Go do something repugnant and
give us something to talk about next
week.
INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various
desks.
Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta. She attempts to
get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten
MANDELLA
Look, it's really easy.
TREVOR
You're a freedom fighter. Be proud,
sister.
Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book.
MANDELLA
(rotely)
It's Mandella with two L's. I am not
related to Nelson Mandela. I am not a
political figure. I do not live in
South Africa. My parents just spent a
few too many acid trips thinking they
were revolutionaries.
TREVOR
But you freed our people
MANDELLA
Your ""people"" are white, suburban high
school boys who smoke too much hemp. I
have not freed you, Trevor.
(grabbing his arm
dramatically)
Only you can free yourself.
ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as
can be
BIANCA
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
CAMERON
Right. See? You're ready for the
quiz.
BIANCA
I don't want to know how to say that
though. I want to know useful things.
Like where the good stores are. How
much does champagne cost? Stuff like
Chat. I have never in my life had to
point out my head to someone.
CAMERON
That's because it's such a nice one.
BIANCA
Forget French.
She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile
BIANCA
(continuing)
How is our little Find the Wench A Date
plan progressing?
CAMERON
Well, there's someone I think might be
--
Bianca's eyes light up
BIANCA
Show me
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously.
Bianca plays it cool.
BIANCA
Give me a sign when he walks by. And
don't point.
The bell RINGS. Kids flood past. Then Patrick saunters by
with Scurvy. Cameron nudges Bianca.
CAMERON
There.
BIANCA
Where?
Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across
Patrick's path. Patrick shoves him back against the wall
without a thought. Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca's
feet.
CAMERON
I guess he didn't see me
(calling after
Patrick)
Some other time --
Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in her eye.
BIANCA
My God, he's repulsive. He's so
perfect!
INT. GYM CLASS - DAY
Several volleyball games are being played.
Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach
Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym
clothes. They pull him aside roughly.
PATRICK
(shrugging them
off)
What?
Joey points
JOEY See that girl?
Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the
ball into some poor cowboy's face.
PATRICK
Yeah
JOEY
What do you think?
Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared
of her.
PATRICK
Two legs, nice rack...
JOEY
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out
with her.
PATRICK
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
JOEY
You just said
PATRICK
You need money to take a girl out
JOEY
But you'd go out with her if you had
the cake?
Patrick stares at Joey deadpan. His dislike for the guy
obvious.
PATRICK
(sarcastic)
Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had
the plane.
Joey smiles.
JOEY
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab,
you do the honors.
PATRICK
You're gonna pay me to take out some
girl?
JOEY
I can't date her sister until that one
gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch.
She doesn't want a boyfriend.
PATRICK
How much?
JOEY
Twenty bucks each time you take her out.
PATRICK
I can't take a girl like that out on
twenty bucks.
JOEY
Fine, thirty.
Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up
JOEY
(continuing)
Take it or leave it. This isn't a
negotiation.
PATRICK
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Patrick walks away with a smile
EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice
session. Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over
the field.
Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching. A cigarette
dangles from his mouth. His pal, SCURVY is next to him.
MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.
MR. CHAPIN
(proudly)
Good run, Stratford.
Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick
hops down to follow.
PATRICK
Hey. Girlie.
Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.
PATRICK
(continuing)
I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?
KAT
(smiles brightly)
Sweating like a pig, actually. And
yourself?
PATRICK
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
KAT
My mission in life.
She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
KAT
(continuing)
Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So,
you see, it worked. The world makes
sense again.
Patrick's eyes narrow. He steps closer.
PATRICK
Pick you up Friday, then
KAT
Oh, right. Friday.
PATRICK backs up a little. He uses his most seductive tone
PATRICK
The night I take you to places you've
never been before. And back.
KAT
Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside?
Do you even know my name, screwboy?
PATRICK
I know a lot more than that
Kat stares at him.
KAT
Doubtful. Very doubtful.
She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.
PATRICK
(calling after her)
You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
Scurvy appears at his side
SCURVY
So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a
new Blaupunkt.
ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
MICHAEL
He took the bait.
STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
Kat washes her face at the sink. Bianca appears behind her,
and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon.
She wacks Bianca away.
BIANCA
Have you ever considered a new look? I
mean, seriously, you could have some
potential buried under all this
hostility.
Kat pushes past her into the hallway.
KAT
I have the potential to smack the crap
out of you if you don't get out of my
way.
BIANCA
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
Kat SLAMS her door in response.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit
SCURVY You up for a burger?
Patrick looks in his wallet. It's empty.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books. Patrick
appears at her side, smiling.
PATRICK
Hey
Kat doesn't answer
PATRICK
(continuing)
You hate me don't you?
KAT
I don't really think you warrant that
strong an emotion.
PATRICK
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at
the track with me.
KAT
And why would I do that?
PATRICK
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer,
you with money in your eyes, me with my
hand on your ass...
KAT
You -- covered in my vomit.
PATRICK
Seven-thirty?
She slams her locker shut and walks away
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in her
teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands. She
finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.
She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her
car
PATRICK
Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.
KAT
Are you following me?
PATRICK
I was in the laundromat. I saw your
car. Thought I'd say hi.
KAT
Hi
She gets in and starts the car.
PATRICK
You're not a big talker, are you?
KAT
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't
really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper,
which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.
Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store
KAT
(continuing)
Hey -- do you mind?
JOEY
Not at all
They continue on into the store. Kat stares at them in
disbelief...
Then BACKS UP
Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey's precious
Viper.
Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the
liquor store.
JOEY
(continuing)
You fucking bitch!
Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again. Smiling
sweetly.
INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.
WALTER
My insurance does not cover PMS
KAT
Then tell them I had a seizure.
WALTER
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You
punishing me?
KAT
I thought you were punishing me.
WALTER
Why can't we agree on this?
KAT
Because you're making decisions for me.
WALTER
As a parent, that's my right
KAT
So what I want doesn't matter?
WALTER
You're eighteen. You don't know what
you want. You won't know until you're
forty-five and you don't have it.
KAT
(emphatic)
I want to go to an East Coast school! I
want you to trust me to make my own
choices. I want --
Walter's BEEPER goes off
WALTER
Christ! I want a night to go by that
I'm not staring a contraction in the
face.
He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing
Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him.
JOEY
When I shell out fifty, I expect
results.
PATRICK
I'm on it
JOEY
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't
count as a date.
PATRICK
I got her under control. She just acts
crazed in public to keep up the image.
Joey sees through the bluff
JOEY
Let me put it to you this way, if you
don't get any action, I don't get any
action. So get your ass on hers by the
end of the week.
Joey starts to walk off
PATRICK
I just upped my price
JOEY
(turning)
What?
PATRICK
A hundred bucks a date.
JOEY
Forget it.
PATRICK
Forget her sister, then.
Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES the locker,
then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a menacing
scowl.
JOEY
You better hope you're as smooth as you
think you are, Verona.
Patrick takes the money with a smile.
INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca.
CAMERON
La copine et I 'ami? La diferance?
Bianca glares at him.
BIANCA
A ""copine"" is someone you can count on.
An ""ami"" is someone who makes promises
he can't keep.
Cameron closes the French book
CAMERON
You got something on your mind?
BIANCA
I counted on you to help my cause. You
and that thug are obviously failing.
Aren't we ever going on our date?
He melts
CAMERON
You have my word. As a gentleman
BIANCA
You're sweet.
She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches
her toss her hair back
CAMERON
(appreciative)
How do you get your hair to look like
that?
BIANCA
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days.
And I never, ever use a blowdryer
without the diffuser attachment.
Cameron nods with interest.
CAMERON
You know, I read an article about that.
Bianca looks surprised.
BIANCA
You did?
INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and
Cameron cower in the corner, watching him.
PATRICK
(without turning
around)
Say it
MICHAEL
(clearing his
throat)
What?
PATRICK
Whatever the hell it is you're standin'
there waitin' to say.
Cameron bravely steps forward
CAMERON
We wanted to talk to you about the
plan.
Patrick turns toward them.
PATRICK
What plan?
MICHAEL
The situation is, my man Cameron here
has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
PATRICK
What is it with this chick? She have
three tits?
Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.
MICHAEL
I think I speak correctly when I say
that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than
say -- Joey Dorsey's.
PATRICK
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm
just in this for the cash.
Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his
beloved Bianca.
MICHAEL
That's where we can help you. With
Kat.
PATRICK
So Dorsey can get the girl?
MICHAEL
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the
big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set
this whole thing up so Cameron can get
the girl.
Patrick smiles. He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in
this game.
PATRICK
You two are gonna help me tame the wild
beast?
MICHAEL
(grinning)
We're your guys.
CAMERON
And he means that strictly in a non-
prison-movie type of way.
PATRICK
Yeah -- we'll see.
He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and
Cameron grinning at each other.
MICHAEL
We're in.
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
CU on a party invitation as it gets handed out. ""Future
Princeton Grad Bogey Lowenstein proudly presents a Saturday
night bash at his abode. Casual attire"".
Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron.
CAMERON
This is it. A golden opportunity.
Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
MICHAEL
In that case, we'll need to make it a
school-wide blow out.
CAMERON
Will Bogey get bent?
MICHAEL
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself
with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
CAFETERIA - DAY
Michael hands a jock the party invite as they pass each
other at the trash cans.
INT. GYM CLASS - DAY
The jock calls a fellow jock
INT. MATH CLASS - DAY
Jock whispers to a cheerleader
COURTYARD - DAY
The cheerleader calls a White Rasta that she's making out
with, showing him the invite.
TRACK - DAY
The White Rasta tells a cowboy as they run laps during track
practice.
INT. SHOWERS - DAY
The cowboy Cells a Coffee Kid, as he shields his java from
the spray of the shower.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Joey stands ac his open locker with Bianca. The locker is
an homage to Joey's ""modeling"" career. Cheesy PRINT ADS of
him -- running in a field of daisies, petting a kitten, etc.
-- adorn the locker door.
JOEY
Which do you like better?
INSERT - HEADSHOTS of Joey. In one, he's pouting in a white
shirt. In the other, he's pouting in a black shirt.
BIANCA
I think I like the white shirt
Joey nods thoughtfully.
JOEY
It's more
BIANCA
Expensive?
JOEY
Exactly
(beat)
So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's
thing on Saturday?
BIANCA
Hopefully.
He gives her his best flirtatious smile
JOEY
Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if
you won't be there.
He taps her on the nose and she giggles
INT. TUTORING ROOM
Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always
BIANCA
Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's
party?
CAMERON
Sure have.
BIANCA
(pouting)
I really, really, really wanna go, but
I can't. Not unless my sister goes.
CAMERON
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem
to be goin' for him.
He fishes.
CAMERON
(continuing)
She's not a...
BIANCA
Lesbian? No. I found a picture of
Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm
pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex
tendencies.
CAMERON
So that's the kind of guy she likes?
Pretty ones?
BIANCA
Who knows? All I've ever heard her say
is that she'd dip before dating a guy
that smokes.
Cameron furiously takes notes
CAMERON
All right. What else is she partial
to?
INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT
Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies.
He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door. LOU the
bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out.
PATRICK
Lou, it's okay. They're with me.
Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our
two non-deviants pass through.
Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.
PATRICK
(continuing)
What've you got for me?
CAMERON
I've retrieved certain pieces of
information on Miss Katarina Stratford I
think you'll find helpful.
Cameron pulls out a piece of paper.
MICHAEL
(to Patrick)
One question before we start -- should you be drinking
alcohol when you don't have a liver?
PATRICK
What?!
MICHAEL
Good enough.
Cameron looks up at Patrick.
CAMERON
Number one. She hates smokers
MICHAEL
It's a lung cancer issue
CAMERON
Her favorite uncle
MICHAEL
Dead at forty-one.
Patrick sits up
PATRICK
Are you telling me I'm a -
(spits the word
out)
""non-smoker""?
MICHAEL
Just for now.
CAMERON
Another thing. Bianca said that Kat
likes -- pretty guys.
This is met with silence. Then:
PATRICK
What? You don't think I'm pretty?
Michael smacks Cameron
MICHAEL
He's pretty!
CAMERON
Okay! I wasn't sure
Cameron goes back to the list.
CAMERON
(continuing)
Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist
prose, and ""angry, stinky girl music of
the indie-rock persuasion"".
PATRICK
So what does that give me? I'm
supposed to buy her some noodles and a
book and sit around listening to chicks
who can't play their instruments?
MICHAEL
Ever been to Club Skunk?
PATRICK
Yeah.
CAMERON
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow
night.
PATRICK
Don't make me do it, man
MICHAEL
Assail your ears for one night.
CAMERON
It's her favorite band.
Patrick groans
MICHAEL
I also retrieved a list of her most
recent CD purchases, courtesy of
American Express.
He hands it over.
PATRICK
(smiling)
Michael -- did you get this information
""illegally""?
Michael puts a finger to his lips.
MICHAEL
I prefer to think of it simply as an
alternative to what the law allows.
PATRICK
I'm likin' you guys better
He looks down at the list of CDs.
PATRICK
(continuing)
This is really music?
INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT
MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with
indie rock band posters and flyers.
Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up
Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.
BIANCA
Can you turn down the Screaming
Menstrual Bitches? I'm trying to study.
Kat doesn't move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning
down the volume.
BIANCA
(continuing)
Don't tell me you're actually going
out? On a school night, no less.
Kat shoots her a glare
BIANCA
(continuing;
excited)
Oh my God, does this mean you're
becoming normal?
KAT
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at
Club Skunk and we're going.
BIANCA
(disappointed)
Oh, I thought you might have a date
(beat)
I don't know why I'm bothering to ask,
but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's
party Saturday night?
KAT
What do you think?
BIANCA
I think you're a freak. I think you do
this to torture me. And I think you
suck.
She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her. Kat
doesn't bat an eye. She grabs her purse and opens the door
KAT
Let's hit it.
EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the
line of kids below.
INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her
fake ID. The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically
mono-syllabic.
MANDELLA
(whispering to Kat)
You think this'll work?
KAT
No fear.
They approach Bruce. Kat puts on her happy, shiny face
KAT
(continuing)
Hello! We'd like two for Gigglepuss!
Bruce looks the girls up and down.
BRUCE
I can count.
He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside,
wearing a face that could only be described as ""I AM a
Victoria's Secret model.""
MANDELLA
I'll bet you can..
She sticks out her chest and licks her lips. Bruce stares
at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs.
BRUCE
Go ahead.
(to Mandella)
And you
MANDELLA
(all come hither)
Yes?
BRUCE
Take it easy on the guys in there.
Mandella winks at him and sashays inside Kat: follows
behind, shaking her head.
EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.
INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked
PIERCED EYEBROW BOY. Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the
boy's inside pocket.
BRUCE
Next time, leave the Bic at home,
Skippy.
SKIPPY
It's a bottle opener.
Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.
BRUCE
Verona, my man.
They shake.
PATRICK
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
BRUCE
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss
fan. Aren't they a little too pre-teen
belly-button ring for you?
PATRICK
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of
minors come in?
BRUCE
Never
PATRICK
Padua girls. One tall, decent body.
The other one kinda short and
undersexed?
BRUCE
Just sent 'em through.
Patrick starts to go in
BRUCE
(continuing)
Hey -- what happened to that chick you
brought last time? The one with the
snake?
Patrick laughs and goes into the club
INT. CLUB - NIGHT
Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their
bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.
Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR
Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss
finishes a song.
LEAD SINGER
Hello, out there. We're Gigglepuss and
we're from Olympia.
A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to
scream.
BOY (0.S.)
Pet my kitty!
LEAD SINGER
Meow
They rev into their next song.
NEAR THE STAGE
Mandella and Kat glow with sweat. When they hear the
opening chords of the song, they look at each other and
scream with glee as they begin to dance. They couldn't be
having a better time.
AT THE BAR
Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks
across the bouncing surge of the crowd. He spots Kat and
Mandella singing along.
HIS POV
The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease.
None of her usual ""attitude"". Patrick is transfixed. And
most definitely attracted.
NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.
KAT
(shouting)
I need agua!
She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR
She made it. She signals for the bartender and as she's
waiting, looks around. She spots Patrick a few feet away
KAT
(continuing to
herself)
Shit
She sneaks a glance. He's staring, but this time he looks
away before she can. Despite herself, she's miffed.
The bartender arrives
BARTENDER
(shouting)
What can I get you?
KAT
Two waters.
She looks at Patrick again. He's completely absorbed in the
band. She scowls. The bottled water arrives and she
marches off, forgetting to pay.
She walks up to Patrick.
KAT
(continuing)
You're not fooling anyone.
Patrick looks at her, surprised
PATRICK
(yelling)
hey. Great show, huh?
KAT
(yelling)
If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it
over with.
PATRICK
(yelling)
Excuse me?
KAT
(yelling)
That's what you want, isn't it?
PATRICK
(yelling; gesturing
toward the band)
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it
for me.
Kat steams. And watches him watch the band
KAT
(yelling)
You're not surrounded by your usual
cloud of smoke.
The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now
PATRICK
I know. I quit.
He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her. She moves
closer.
KAT
Oh, really?
He motions toward the stage
PATRICK
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill
or The Raincoats, but they're right up
there.
KAT
You know who The Raincoats are?
PATRICK
Why, don't you?
She's completely taken aback. He uses the moment to his
advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into
her ear.
PATRICK
(continuing)
I watched you out there I've never
seen you look like that
Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched
Her cheeks pinken.
His cocky side is back in a flash
PATRICK
(continuing)
Come to that party with me.
At that moment, the band starts another SONG
KAT
(yelling)
What?
The bartender approaches.
BARTENDER
(to Kat, yelling)
You forgot to pay!
PATRICK
(yelling)
I got it, Rick.
He tosses some bills on the bar
Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to
figure out his motive.
PATRICK
(continuing;
yelling)
Nine-thirty then.
A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she
can't hear a word he's saying. She gives him one last look
and heads back into the crowd.
Patrick smiles. She didn't say no this time.
EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst
them. A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick
coasts by in his truck. The gears GRIND. He yells out the
window.
MANDELLA
What'd he say?
KAT
Who cares?
Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick
MANDELLA
Has he importun'd you with love in
honourable fashion?
Kat glances sharply at her.
MANDELLA
(continuing; off
her look)
Don't be Cruella with me. I'm in favor
of romance. You're the one that wants
to march on Washington every five
minutes.
Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.
KAT
Gigglepuss was so beyond.
Mandella nods.
MANDELLA
They were. I only wish William could
have been here to witness the rebirth of
punk rock with us.
Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the
car.
KAT
So true.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker.
CAMERON
So, then she says that she almost
didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that
dress because she thought she was
mixing, you know, genres. And the fact
that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here -
""really meant something.""
Cameron looks At Michael expectantly
MICHAEL
You told me that part already.
CAMERON
Hell, I've just been going over the
whole thing in my head and -
Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder.
JOEY
Hey. Dingo Boingo
Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around
slowly
JOEY
(continuing; to
Michael)
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
MICHAEL
Uh, yeah. We're old friend*
JOEY
You and Verona?
MICHAEL
What? We took bathes together when we
were kids.
It's incredibly obvious that he's lying. Joey eyes him then
turns to Cameron.
JOEY
What's your gig in all this?
CAMERON
I'm just the new guy.
Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his
shirt and twisting it.
JOEY
You better not fuck this up. I'm
heavily invested.
MICHAEL
Hey -- it's all for the higher good
right?
Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker
for good measure, as he walks away-
CAMERON
Is it about me?
EXT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and
annoyed.
The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out
MISS PERKY
You're completely demented.
PATRICK
(cheery)
See you next week!
Kat stands and Patrick sees her.
Miss Perky watches in horror
MISS PERKY
You two know each other?
PATRICK/KAT
Yeah/No.
Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.
MISS PERKY
(to Patrick)
Dear God, stay away from her. If you
two ever decided to breed, evil would
truly walk the earth.
Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then
smiles-
EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
The lights are on, illuminating the yard
INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room. MUSIC is
blaring and the door is shut. Bianca looks at her watch
BIANCA
She's obviously not going.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak
past. Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.
FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard. The girls freeze.
Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich
The girls are like statues. Walter jumps.
BIANCA
Daddy, I --
WALTER
And where're you going?
BIANCA
If you must know, we were attempting to
go to a small study group of friends.
WALTER
Otherwise known as an orgy?
BIANCA
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew
you'd forbid me to go since ""Gloria
Steinem"" over there isn't going --
She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes
downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis. Her
relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
school look. She wanders toward the kitchen.
Walter directs his attention toward Kat.
WALTER
Do you know about any party? Katarina?
Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an
apple
BIANCA
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
WALTER
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze
BIANCA
You're ruining my life' Because you
won't be normal, I can't be normal.
KAT
What's normal?
BIANCA
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but
you're too busy listening to Bitches Who
Need Prozac to know that.
WALTER
What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle
BIANCA
Can't you forget for just one night
that you're completely wretched?
KAT
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked
hedge-pig.
Bianca tosses her hair.
BIANCA
Like I'm supposed to know what that
even means.
KAT
It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard
of him?
BIANCA
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's
boyfriend. I guess since I'm not
allowed to go out, I should obsess over
a dead guy, too.
WALTER
Girls
Kat stares Bianca down
KAT
I know about the goddamn party. I'm
going.
Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst
into gleeful screams.
A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.
WALTER
Oh, God. It's starting.
BIANCA
It's just a party. Daddy.
Walter looks dazed.
WALTER
Wear the belly before you go.
BIANCA
Daddy, no!
WALTER
Just for a minute
He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux-
pregnancy belly.
WALTER
(continuing)
I want you to realize the weight of
your decisions.
He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.
BIANCA
You are so completely unbalanced.
KAT
Can we go now?

WALTER
(to Bianca)
Promise me you won't talk to any boys
unless your sister is present.
BIANCA
Why?
WALTER
Because she'll scare them away.
Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall
table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the
door and...
There stands Patrick.
PATRICK
Nine-thirty right?
Kat's in shock
PATRICK
(continuing)
I'm early.
She holds up her keys
KAT
I'm driving.
He peeks in behind her.
PATRICK
Who knocked up your sister?
INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a
pro, handing out cigars and martinis.
BOGEY
Nice to see you. Martini bar to the
right, shots in the kitchen.
The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat
pushes through the crowd. Patrick saunters in behind her
INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and
hollering within the jock crowd.
Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face. Joey
sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the
doorway.
JOEY
Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his
forehead.
KAT
Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline
just recede?
He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror She's
already walking away.
JOEY
Where ya goin?
KAT
Away.
JOEY
Your sister here?
Kat's face shows utter hatred
KAT
Leave my sister alone.
JOEY
(smirking)
And why would I do that?
A RUCKUS sounds from the next room
JOCK
A fight!
The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash
their cupfuls on each other.
COFFEE KID #1
That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you
Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.
Caffeinated fists fly. Joey slithers away from the door to
watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into
the kitchen.
JOEY
Just who I was looking for.
He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out
KAT
BIANCA
Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts
another.
GUY
Drink up, sister.
Patrick walks up
PATRICK
What's this?
KAT
(mocking)
""I'm getting trashed, man."" Isn't that
what you're supposed to do at a party?
PATRICK
I say, do what you wanna do.
KAT
Funny, you're the only one
She downs another.
INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Cameron and Michael enter. Cameron looks, around for his
beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and
dishes dirt simultaneously.
MICHAEL
(high-fiving a
jock)
Moose, my man!
(to Cameron)
Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters
have already started calling.
Cameron nods intently
MICHAEL
(continuing;
grabbing his belt)
Yo, Clem.
(to Cameron)
A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new
Leanne Rimes.
(with a Jamaican
swagger)
Ziggy, peace, bra.
(to Cameron)
Prefers a water pipe, but has been
known to use a bong.
Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish,
and points Cameron's body in her direction.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Follow the love, man
ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck
BIANCA
Where did he go? He was just here.
CHASTITY
Who?
BIANCA
Joey.
Cameron walks over.
CAMERON
Evening, ladies.
Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.
BIANCA
Hi.
CAMERON
Looks like things worked out tonight,
huh?
Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off
BIANCA
You know Chastity?
CAMERON
I believe we share an art instructor
CHASTITY
Great
BIANCA
Would you mind getting me a drink,
Cameron?
CAMERON
Certainly
Pabst? Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
Bianca gives him a tense smile.
BIANCA
Surprise me.
He heads for the kitchen. Joey walks up and grabs her
around the waist.
She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just
as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and
straw -- in his hand.
Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey,
then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.
Michael appears.
MICHAEL
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
CAMERON
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy
just picks up a girl and carries her
away while you're talking to her?
MICHAEL
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're
making progress.
CAMERON
No, I ' m not.
He smacks himself in the head
CAMERON
(continuing)
She used me! She wants to go out with
Dorsey. Not me. I'm an idiot!
Michael pats him on the shoulder.
MICHAEL
At least you're self-aware
BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a
drunken group hug singing ""I Shot the Sheriff"". Kat has
another shot glass in hand.
Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured
cheerleader. He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes
then looks away.
INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer
JOEY
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog
thing going -- and the tube sock gig ""
that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up
for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
BIANCA
Queen Harry?
JOEY
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be,
like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting
difficult.
BIANCA
Neat...
JOEY
My agent says I've got a good shot at
being the Prada guy next year.
He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone. Bianca
takes the opportunity to escape.
BIANCA
I'll be right back.
INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh. Chastity
applies lip-gloss in the mirror.
BIANCA
He practically proposed when he found
out we had the same dermatologist. I
mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all,
but he's not exactly relevant party
conversation.
CHASTITY
Is he oily or dry?
BIANCA
Combination. I don't know -- I thought
he'd be different. More of a
gentleman...
Chastity rolls her eyes
CHASTITY
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of
dating Joey Dorsey are going to include
door-opening and coat-holding.
BIANCA
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're
supposed to want to go out with are the
ones we actually want to go out with,
you know?
CHASTITY
All I know is -- I'd give up my private
line to go out with a guy like Joey.
There's a KNOCK at the door. Bianca opens it to find a very
drunken Kat.
KAT
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need
to tell you --
BIANCA
(cutting her off)
I really don't think I need any social
advice from you right now.
Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit
INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER
Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand.
PATRICK
Maybe you should let me have it.
Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go
KAT
I want another one
Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting
him from his task.
JOEY
My man
As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of
dancing people in the dining room.
PATRICK
(annoyed)
It's about time.
JOEY
A deal's a deal.
He peels off some bills
JOEY
(continuing)
How'd you do it?
PATRICK
Do what?
JOEY
Get her to act like a human
A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and
starts dancing by herself. She lets loose, hair flying.
She's almost burlesque.
Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on
She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot
hanging from the rack above the center island. She starts
to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.
The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale.
Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up
PATRICK
Okay?
KAT
I'm fine. I'm
She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs
her again, bracing her.
PATRICK
You're not okay.
KAT
I just need to lie down for awhile
PATRICK
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to
sleep
KAT
I know, just let me sleep
PATRICK
What if you have a concussion? My dog
went to sleep with a concussion and woke
up a vegetable. Not that I could tell
the difference...
She tries to sit on the floor
KAT
Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake,
okay?
He pulls her back to her
PATRICK
C'mon, let's walk
INT. BOGEY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron grabs
his arm.
CAMERON We need to talk.
PATRICK
Cameron, I'm a little busy
CAMERON
It's off. The whole thing.
Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to get h
back on her feet.
PATRICK
What 're you talking about?
CAMERON
She's partial to Joey, not me
Patrick doesn't have time for this.
PATRICK
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
CAMERON
Sure
PATRICK
(impatient)
Then, go get her
Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside. Cameron
stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice
EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up
KAT
This is so patronizing.
PATRICK
Leave it to you to use big words when
you're shitfaced.
KAT
Why 're you doing this?
PATRICK
I told you
KAT
You don't care if I die
PATRICK
Sure, I do
KAT
Why?
PATRICK
Because then I'd have to start taking
out girls who like me.
KAT
Like you could find one
PATRICK
See that? Who needs affection when
I've got blind hatred?
KAT
Just let me sit down.
He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a
swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.
PATRICK
How's that?
She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then
FALLS over backward.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Jesus. You're like a weeble
Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the
swing to keep her entertained.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Why'd you let him get to you?
KAT
Who?
PATRICK
Dorsey.
KAT
I hate him.
PATRICK
I know. It'd have to be a pretty big
deal to get you to mainline tequila. You
don't seem like the type.
KAT
(holding up a
drunken head)
Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can
be ""cool""? You don't think I can be
""laid back"" like everyone else?
PATRICK
(slightly
sarcastic)
I thought you were above all that
KAT
You know what they say
He stops the swing
PATRICK
No. What do they say?
Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Shit!
He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up
damn it!
He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag
doll.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Kat! Wake up!
KAT
(waking)
What?
He sighs with relief.
PATRICK
I thought you were...
They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES
on his shoes.
INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a
big swig.
A KNOCK sounds at the door
KAT
Go away
Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the
smuggest of all possible grins.
BIANCA
Dinner taste better on the way out?
Gives her a ""don't even start"" look.
BIANCA
(continuing)
I don't get you. You act like you're
too good for any of this, and then you
go totally apeshit when you get here.
KAT
You're welcome.
She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.
KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
Kat's in the driver's seat. Patrick leans in and takes the
keys out of the ignition.
PATRICK
Cute
BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Kids loiter on the lawn. Bianca and Chastity walk outside
Joey catches up to them.
JOEY
A bunch of us are going to Jaret's
house. Wanna come?
Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.
She looks at her watch.
BIANCA
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
CHASTITY
(eagerly, to Joey)
I don't have to be home 'til two.
JOEY
Then, c'mon.
(to Bianca)
Maybe next time --
They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca
Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca
standing alone.
CAMERON
(slightly
accusatory)
Have fun tonight?
BIANCA
Tons
He starts to walk on
BIANCA
(continuing)
Cameron?
He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.
BIANCA
(continuing)
Do you think you could give me a ride
home?
INT. KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling
with the radio dial. She finds a SONG she's happy with and
Patrick quickly changes it.
PATRICK
I'm driving, so I get to pick the
tunes.
She changes it back to her song.
KAT
It's my car.
He changes it back.
PATRICK
And I'm in control of it.
KAT
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like
them. I saw you there.
Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her
listen to her song.
KAT
(continuing)
When you were gone last year -- where
were you?
PATRICK
Busy
KAT
Were you in jail?
PATRICK
Maybe.
KAT
No, you weren't
PATRICK
Then why'd you ask?
KAT
Why'd you lie?
He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the
music. She bobs her head drunkenly.
KAT
(continuing)
I should do this.
PATRICK
Do what?
KAT
This.
She points to the radio
PATRICK
Start a band?
KAT
(sarcastically)
My father wouldn't approve of that that
PATRICK
You don't strike me as the type that
would ask permission.
She turns to look at him.
KAT
Oh, so now you think you know me?
PATRICK
I'm gettin' there
Her voice loses it's venom
KAT
The only thing people know about me is
that I'm ""scary"".
He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary
right now. He tries to hide his smile.
PATRICK
Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself.
They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection,
realizing they're both created the same exterior for
themselves.
Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor. He
looks up at her house.
PATRICK
(continuing)
So what ' s up with your dad? He a
pain in the ass?
KAT
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
PATRICK
Who?
KAT
BIANCA
PATRICK
No offense, but you're sister is
without. I know everyone likes her and
all, but ...
Kat stares at him with new admiration.
KAT
You know -- you're not as vile as I
thought you were.
She leans drunkenly toward him.
Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then
Patrick turns away
PATRICK
So, I'll see you in school
Kat stares at him, pissed. Then gets out of the car,
SLAMMING the door shut behind her.
CAMERON'S CAR - NIGHT
Bianca and Cameron ride in silence.
He finally breaks it.
CAMERON
I looked for you back at the party, but
you always seemed to be ""occupied"".
BIANCA
(faux-innocence )
I was?
CAMERON
You never wanted to go out with 'me,
did you?
Bianca bites her lip.
BIANCA
(reluctant)
Well, no...
CAMERON
Then that's all you had to say.
BIANCA
But
CAMERON
You always been this selfish?
BIANCA thinks a minute
He pulls up in front of the house
CAMERON
Just because you're beautiful, doesn't
mean you can treat people like they
don't matter.
She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and
gives him a kiss on the lips. He draws back in surprise,
then kisses her back. She smiles, then gets out of the car
without another word.
Cameron grins and drives away
CAMERON
(continuing)
And I'm back in the saddle.
INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the
others enter. The White Rastas are first.
DEREK
Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of
my heart.
He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.
CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found
friendliness.
CLEM
Yippe kai-aye, bra.
(to Kat)
Dance for me, cowgirl.
He sits next to Derek
CLEM
(continuing)
Okay, now tell me again why he didn't
shoot the deputy?
DEREK
Because the deputy meant him no harm,
my friend. It was only the sheriff that
was the oppressor.
Joey saunters in and takes his seat.
JOEY
Kat, babe, you were on fire.
Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk
MRS. BLAISE
Well now, did everyone have a good
weekend?
JOEY
Maybe we should ask Verona
Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk. Kat looks up,
down and around, everywhere but at Patrick.
Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk
about.
MRS. BLAISE
Okay then. Well.
(beat)
Oh, yes
She clears her throat.
MRS. BLAISE
(continuing)
I'd like you all to write your own
version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.
Groans.
MRS. BLAISE
(continuing)
Any form you'd like. Rhyme, no rhyme,
whatever. I'd like to see you elaborate
on his theme, however. Let's read it
aloud, shall we? Anyone?
The class is frozen in apathy.
MRS. BLAISE
(continuing)
Derek?
Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in
his seat. Then grins.
DEREK
(reading; in his
Rasta stoner drawl)
In faith, I do not love thee with mine
eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors
note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what
they despise/ Who in despite of view is
pleas 'd to dote.
In the back of the room Clem raises his hand
CLEM
Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom
pass? Damn if Shakespeare don't act as
a laxative on my person.
INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
Kat and Mandella scrape the peanuts out of their sauce.
MANDELLA
You went to the party? I thought we
were officially opposed to suburban
social activity.
KAT
I didn't have a choice.
MANDELLA
You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat
and what have you done with her?
KAT
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
MANDELLA
You didn't
KAT
I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected.
It was big fun.
Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat
and smiles.
PATRICK
Hey
She gathers her things and bolts out the door. Patrick
looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.
INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY Cameron and Michael flank Patrick
at his lab table
MICHAEL
So you got cozy with she who stings?
PATRICK
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that
I'm about to lose.
CAMERON
What'd you do to her?
PATRICK
I don ' t know.
(beat)
I decided not to nail her when she was
too drunk to remember it.
Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then
turn back to Patrick.
CAMERON
You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.
PATRICK
No shit. She won't even look at me
CAMERON
Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?
Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility.
Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.
MICHAEL
I'm on it
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Mandella is at her locker. Drawings of William Shakespeare
adorn the door. She looks at them with a sigh, then ties
her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut
off her air supply.
Michael walks up.
MICHAEL
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
MANDELLA
(shyly, as she
loosens the scarf)
Hi.
MICHAEL
Cool pictures. You a fan?
MANDELLA
Yeah. I guess.
MICHAEL rocks. Very hip.
MANDELLA
You think?
MICHAEL
Oh yeah.
She looks at him suspiciously
MANDELLA
Who could refrain that had a heart to
love and in that heart, courage to make
' B love known?
Michael thinks for a minute.
MICHAEL
Macbeth, right?
MANDELLA
(happily stunned)
Right.
MICHAEL
Kat a fan, too?
MANDELLA
(puzzled)
Yeah...
He leans in close to her, conspiratorially
MICHAEL
So, listen... I have this friend
EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
Cameron sits next to Patrick on the bleachers as they watch
Kat's practice.
CAMERON
She hates you with the fire of a
thousand suns . That's a direct quote
PATRICK
She just needs time to cool off I'll
give it a day.
A PUCK flies at them from the field, narrowly missing their
heads.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Maybe two.
He looks at Cameron.
PATRICK
(continuing)
You makin' any headway?
CAMERON
She kissed me.
PATRICK
(eyebrow raised)
Where?
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Chastity rounds the corner and bends down to get a drink
from the water fountain.
NEARBY
Joey stands talking to two JOCK COHORTS. The guys don't see
her.
JOEY
Don't talk to me about the sweetest
date. That little halo Bianca is gonna
be prone and proven on prom night. Six
virgins in a row.
The cohorts chortle Chastity keeps drinking from the
fountain
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Joey leans against Patrick's Jeep. Patrick is inside.
PATRICK
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the
flowers. Another hundred for the tux --
JOEY
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I
know.
He pulls out his wallet and hands Patrick a wad of money
JOEY
(continuing)
Take it
Patrick does, with a smile, as he ROARS out of the parking
lot.
INT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
Kat and Mandella deface a prom flyer.
KAT
Can you even imagine? Who the hell
would go to this a bastion of commercial
excess?
MANDELLA
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't
have dates .
KAT
Listen to you! You sound like Betty,
all pissed off because Archie is taking
Veronica.
MANDELLA
Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like
I have a dress anyway
KAT
You ' re looking at this from the wrong
perspective. We're making a statement.
MANDELLA
(unconvinced)
Oh, good. Something new and different
for us.
EXT. ARCHERY FIELD - DAY
Mr. Chapin patrols as boys and girls shoot arrows at targets
Joey swaggers up to Bianca, who is taking careful aim.
Chastity watches from across the row.
JOEY
Hey, sweet cheeks.
BIANCA
(not looking at
him)
Hi, Joey.
JOEY
You're concentrating awfully hard
considering it's gym class.
She lets the arrow go and turns to look at him.
JOEY
(continuing)
Listen, I want to talk to you about the
prom.
BIANCA
You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat
doesn't go --
In the background, a RASTA crumples to the ground. Hit
A casualty of Gym. Mr. Chapin scurries over.
JOEY
Your sister is going.
Bianca looks at him, surprised
BIANCA
Since when?
Joey takes the bow and arrow from Bianca's hand. He draws
back and takes aim.
JOEY
I'm taking care of it.
Chastity looks over from her spot on the field, but keeps
lips firmly shut.
INT. BOOK STORE - DAY
Kat browses through the feminist lit section
Patrick appears, through a hole in the books.
PATRICK
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine
Mystique? I lost my copy.
KAT
(frowning)
What are you doing here?
PATRICK
I heard there was a poetry reading.
KAT
You 're so --
PATRICK
Pleasant?
Kat stares at him, deadpan.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Wholesome.
KAT
Unwelcome.
PATRICK
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has
her panties in a twist.
KAT
Don't for one minute think that you had
any effect whatsoever on my panties.
PATRICK
So what did I have an effect on ?
KAT
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
She pushes past him and heads out the' door
Pat looks down at the book he's been holding in his hand:
Taming of the Shrew.
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
Cameron and Michael flank Patrick as he shovels food into
mouth.
PATRICK
You were right. She's still pissed.
MICHAEL
Sweet love, renew thy force!
PATRICK
Man -- don't say shit like that to me.
People can hear you.
CAMERON
(exasperated)
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice
yourself on the altar of dignity and
even the score.
MICHAEL
Best case scenario, you're back on the
payroll for awhile.
PATRICK
What's the worst?
CAMERON
You get the girl.
Patrick thinks for a minute
PATRICK
If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz
Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty.
From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG.
Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.
The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge
Family's ""I Think I Love You"". Being sung by Patrick.
PATRICK
(0. S.)
""This morning, I woke up with this
feeling, I didn't know how to deal with,
and so I just decided to myself--""
The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands
beneath the window, crooning.
Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and
doing backup vocal s.
PATRICK
""I'd hide it to myself. And never talk
about it. And didn't I go and shout it
when you walked into the room --""
He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.
IN THE CLASSROOM
Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her.
Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.
OUTSIDE
Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big
finale.
PATRICK
(continuing)
"" I think I love you I ""
INSIDE
The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down,
mortified, but with a slight smile
INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY
Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling
over their misfortune.
MISCREANT
Nice song, Verona.
PATRICK
Flog me.
He makes the appropriate hand gesture
Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front,
ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine
KAT (0. S.)
Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?
Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat
standing in the doorway. She gives him a smile and he perks
up a little.
Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He
turns fully to face her.
KAT
Sir, I'd like to state for the record
that Mr. Verona ' s current
incarceration is unnecessary. I never
filed a complaint.
MR. CHAPIN
You didn't have to. He disrupted a
classroom.
Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the
window.
Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.
She motions again, and looks toward the window with an
expression that says, ""Make a break for it, moron.""
Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick
inches out of his seat toward the window.
The other miscreants watch with glee.
KAT
But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a
simple serenade warrants a week of
detention. There are far more hideous
acts than off-key singing being
performed by the student body on a
regular basis.
Patrick is halfway out the window now. And none too happy
about it, considering they're on the second floor.
He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN. He
starts to turn away from Kat
MR. CHAPIN
You're not gonna change my mind, Kat.
Rules stick.
Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for
the tree.
KAT
Wait, Mr. Chapin. There's something
I've always wanted to show you.
He turns back toward her again, the very second before he
would have spotted Patrick.
Kat glances toward the window. Patrick's just about to make
the jump.
MR. CHAPIN
What?
KAT
These.
From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra
at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the
flash of skin.
Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
MR. CHAPIN
I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.
But if I catch you doing that again,
you'll be in here with the rest of these
guys.
He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without
noticing Patrick's absence.
Kat smiles at him.
KAT
Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
Kat bolts out the door. Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle
mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.
EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN
Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing
no one.
KAT
He left! I sprung the dickhead and he
cruised on me.
PATRICK
(0. S.)
Look up, sunshine
She does. He's still in the tree
PATRICK
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of
heights.
KAT
(smiling)
C'mon. It's not that bad
PATRICK
Try lookin' at it from this angle
She assesses the branch structure
KAT
Put your right foot there --
PATRICK
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
KAT
You want me to climb up and show you
how to get down?
PATRICK
(voice trembling)
Maybe.
She sighs and dose so. When she gets to his level, she
perches on the branch next to him. He grins at her.
Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a
monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been
duped.
KAT
You shit!
She climbs down after him
EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY
Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games
KAT
The Partridge Family?
PATRICK
I figured it had to be something
ridiculous to win your respect. And
piss you off.
KAT
Good call.
PATRICK
So how'd you get Chapin to look the
other way?
KAT
I dazzled him with my wit
She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at
giggling hyenas and wails on it. The barker hands her a
stuffed animal as her prize. She hands it to the small KID
next to her and they continue walking.
PATRICK
(sarcastic)
A soft side? Who knew?
KAT
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
PATRICK
So what's your excuse?
KAT
Acting the way we do.
PATRICK
Yes
KAT
I don't like to do what people expect.
Then they expect it all the time and
they get disappointed when you change.
PATRICK
So if you disappoint them from the
start, you're covered?
KAT
Something like that
PATRICK
Then you screwed up
KAT
How?
PATRICK
You never disappointed me.
She blushes under his gaze
PATRICK
(continuing)
You up for it?
KAT
For. . . ?
He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins
SERIES OF SHOTS:
The two of them creep through the paint-ball course,
stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint
Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of
her face.
Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more
shots, they're both covered in paint
She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is
empty.
KAT
(continuing)
Damn it!
Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle. They land,
laughing.
It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces
are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to
find each other's eyes.
He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips, as he
goes to kiss her.
NEARBY The kid with the stuffed animal, points
KID
Look, Mom
His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has
turned into a passionate kiss
EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway. Their paint wardrobe
has dried by now and they look like refugees from some
strange, yet colorful, war.
KAT
State trooper?
PATRICK
Fallacy.
KAT
The duck?
PATRICK
Hearsay.
KAT
I know the porn career's a lie.
He shuts off the car and turns to her.
PATRICK
Do you?
He kisses her neck. It tickles. She laughs.
KAT
Tell me something true.
PATRICK
I hate peas.
KAT
No -- something real. Something no one
else knows.
PATRICK
(in-between kisses)
You're sweet. And sexy. And
completely hot for me.
KAT
What?
PATRICK
No one else knows
KAT
You're amazingly self-assured. Has
anyone ever told you that?
PATRICK
Go to the prom with me
Kat's smile disappears.
KAT
Is that a request or a command?
PATRICK
You know what I mean
KAT
No.
PATRICK
No what?
KAT
No, I won't go with you
PATRICK
Why not?
KAT
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid
tradition.
Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he
being paid to take her.
PATRICK
People won't expect you to go...
Kat turns to him, getting angry.
KAT
Why are you doing this?
KAT
All of it -- what's in it for you?
He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her
suspicions.
KAT
(continuing)
Create a little drama? Start a new
rumor? What?
PATRICK
So I have to have a motive to be with
you?
KAT
You tell me.
PATRICK
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told
you that?
KAT
(quietly)
Answer the question, Patrick
PATRICK
(angry)
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me.
Just the pleasure of your company.
He takes out a cigarette. She breaks it in half before she
SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front
door and watches him go
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who
has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.
Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey
gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
PATRICK
cover that up
The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face
Bianca TAPS on the open door.
BIANCA
Quick question -- are you going to the
prom?
Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM
INT. STUDY HALL - DAY
Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby. She
fingers a strand of her hair.
BIANCA
Then Guillermo says, ""If you go any
lighter, you're gonna look like an extra
on 90210.""
CAMERON
No...
Bianca stares at him for a moment.
BIANCA
do you listen to this crap?
CAMERON
What crap?
BIANCA
Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm
like, boring myself.
CAMERON
Thank God! If I had to hear one more
story about your coiffure...
He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and
smacks his hand away.
CAMERON
(continuing)
I figured you'd get to the good stuff
eventually.
BIANCA
What good stuff?
CAMERON
The ""real you"".
BIANCA
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
He looks stricken.
BIANCA
(continuing)
I'm kidding.
(beat)
You know how sometimes you just become
this ""persona""? And you don't know how
to quit?
CAMERON
(matter of fact)
No
BIANCA
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how
to lie.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker. Finally, it
opens.
Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th
Century. Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.
INSERT - ""0 FAIR ONE. JOIN ME AT THE PROM. I WILL BE
WAITING. LOVE, WILLIAM S.""
Mandella's agog. Trevor walks by and sees her holding the
dress.
TREVOR
You're gonna look splendiferous in
that, Mandella.
Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.
TREVOR
(continuing)
that's cool to say.
Mandella grins It is
MANDELLA
INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/DEN - DAY
Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike
SHARON
Would you rather be ravished by a
pirate or a British rear admiral?
WALTER
Pirate -- no question.
Bianca enters and walks over to Walter
BIANCA
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with
you. It's tomorrow night --
WALTER
The prom? Kat has a date?
BIANCA
No, but
WALTER
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s
who you want me to bend my rules for?
BIANCA
He's not a ""hot rod"". Whatever that
is.
WALTER
You're not going unless your sister
goes. End of story.
BIANCA
Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my
own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a
possession!
Bianca storms out.
WALTER
(calling out)
You know what happens at proms?
Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter
SHARON
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll
come home. Let her go.
WALTER
Kissing? Is that what you think
happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up
to my elbows in placenta all day.
INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - NIGHT
Bianca lies on her bed. MTV blares. A KNOCK sounds.
BIANCA
Come in.
Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.
KAT
(kindly)
Listen, I know you hate having to sit
home because I'm not Susie High School.
BIANCA
Like you care.
KAT
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in
doing something for your own reasons,
not someone else ' s .
BIANCA
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only
sophomore that got asked to the prom and
I can't go, because you won ' t.
Kat clears her throat
KAT
Joey never told you we went out, did
he?
BIANCA
What?
KAT
In 9th. For a month
BIANCA
(confused)
Why?
KAT
(self-mocking)
He was, like, a total babe
BIANCA
But you hate Joey
KAT
Now I do. Back then, was a different
story.
BIANCA
As in...
Kat takes a deep breath.
KAT
He said everyone was doing it. So I
did it.
BIANCA
You did what?
KAT
(continuing on)
Just once. Afterwards, I told him I
didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready.
He got pissed. Then he broke up with
me.
Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
BIANCA
But
KAT
After that, I swore I'd never do
anything just because ""everyone else""
was doing it. And I haven't since.
Except for Bogey's party, and my
stunning gastro-intestinal display --
BIANCA
(stunned)
Why didn't you tell me?
KAT
I wanted to let you make up your own
mind about him.
BIANCA
No. you didn't! If you really thought
I could make my own decisions, you
would've let me go out with him instead
of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
Kat stands up slowly
KAT
That's not
BIANCA
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your
mistakes.
KAT
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
BIANCA
God, you're just like him! Just keep me
locked away in the dark, so I can't
experience anything for myself
KAT
Not all experiences are good, Bianca.
You can't always trust the people you
want to.
BIANCA
I guess I'll never know, will I?
She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it
behind her.
EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY
Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. She rolls over and
picks up the phone.
BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY
Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while
watching ""I Love Lucy"" reruns.
A KNOCK sounds
BIANCA
Come in.
Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin
KAT
Feel like shopping?
Bianca looks up, hopefully.
LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Walter and Sharon are in front of the television. Walter
has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.
WALTER
What do you wanna watch? We've got
crap, crap, crap or crap
SHARON
Dr. Ruth?
Bianca walks into the living room. She's wearing a prom
dress.
BIANCA
Hi, Mommy.
(looking away)
WALTER
Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca
to Sharon.
SHARON
Honey, you look beautiful!
BIANCA
You like? My date should be here in
five.
WALTER
I'm missing something.
BIANCA
I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a
captain of oppression like some men we
know.
The DOORBELL RINGS. Bianca runs to open it. There stands
CAMERON. He takes in Bianca's outfit.
CAMERON
Wow
BIANCA
Let's go.
Walter rises. Sharon pulls him back down on the couch
SHARON
(to Bianca)
Have a great time, honey!
WALTER
But -- who -- what --?
The door SLAMS. As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a
blur rushes down the stairs and out the door. The blur has
Kat ' s voice.
KAT
Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See
you in a few.
The door SLAMS again. Walter and Sharon 'are alone
WALTER
What just happened?
SHARON
Your daughters went to the prom.
WALTER
Did I have anything to say about it?
SHARON
Absolutely not.
WALTER
That ' s what I thought
The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on
the porch, wearing a tux.
JOEY
I'm here to pick up Bianca.
WALTER
late
He SLAMS the door shut
EXT HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice
gown.
Patrick sits on the steps, waiting. In a tux.
KAT
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
PATRICK
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted.
Where'd you get the dress?
KAT
It's just something I had. You know
PATRICK
(smiling)
Oh huh
KAT
Look, I'm -- sorry -- that I
questioned your motives. I was wrong.
Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile
PATRICK
No prob.
He remains seated. Kat fidgets nervously.
KAT
are you ready?
He rises and stares at her, taking in her image
appreciatively. She blushes and turns away.
KAT
(continuing)
C'mon. Let's get this over with.
INT. PROM - NIGHT
A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world. Patrick
and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.
KAT
Quite the ostentatious display
A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around
PATRICK
Look, Clem even wore his good boots
Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and
Bianca dancing cheek to cheek. She smiles.
ACROSS THE ROOM
Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown,
hair piled on top of her head. She spots Kat and hurries
over.
MANDELLA
Have you seen him?
KAT
Who?
MANDELLA
William - he asked me to meet him here.
KAT
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't'
progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat. She turns and
points Mandella the same way.
Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on
his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella's grin couldn't
be bigger.
Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella's hand
and leading her onto the dance floor.
MICHAEL
Mi' lady.
(to Patrick)
Good sir.
Patrick rolls his eyes.
INT. PROM - NIGHT - LATER
Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG. Whatever he's
whispering into her ear is making her laugh.
Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She
whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies' room
INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a
stall.
BIANCA
(surprised)
What are you doing here?
Chastity checks her hair in the mirror, aloof.
CHASTITY
You think you ' re the only sophomore
at the prom?
BIANCA
I did.
Chastity maintains her snooty tone.
CHASTITY
And just so you know, my date isn't
planning on spending most of the night
in his backseat.
BIANCA What're you talking about?
CHASTITY
Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - -
your cherry. He practically made a
public announcement.
Appalled, Bianca storms out. Chastity tries to backpedal.
CHASTITY
(continuing)
I wanted to tell you
INT. PROM - NIGHT
Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few
stray jocks - also dateless. He zeroes in on Cameron, now
consoling a pissed-off Bianca.
Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the
evil about to erupt.
PATRICK
My grandmother's .
KAT
What?
PATRICK
That's where I was last year. She'd
never lived alone -- my grandfather died
-- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail,
I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've
never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent
a year sitting next to my grandma on the
couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of
story.
He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat
stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh
KAT
That ' s completely adorable!
PATRICK
It gets worse -- you still have your
freshman yearbook?
He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.
JOEY
What's Bianca doing here with that
cheese dick? I didn't pay you to let
some little punk ass snake me.
ACROSS THE ROOM
Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to
Cameron and Bianca.
MICHAEL
(to Cameron)
Feces hitting fan. C'mon
Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca
staring after them.
ACROSS THE ROOM
Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt
Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this
situation.
MICHAEL
(continuing)
Joey, pal, compadre. Let's take it
easy.
Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.
JOEY You two are in big trouble
Cameron faces Joey.
CAMERON
Admit it. You lost. Be a man.
Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise
Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux
The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon
surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White
Rastas.
DEREK
Very uncool, my brother
JOEY
I'm not your brother, white boy.
The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that
they're white.
Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat.
JOEY
(continuing)
Just so you know -- she'll only spread
her legs once.
Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing.
Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back.
It's Bianca. And she BELTS the hell out of him
BIANCA
That's for making my date bleed
She BELTS him again
BIANCA
(continuing)
That's for my sister.
And AGAIN
BIANCA
(continuing)
And that's for me.
Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly.
COWBOY
And that's for the fourth grade,
asshole.
HOTEL - NIGHT
KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her
PATRICK
Wait I...
KAT
You were paid to take me out! By --
the one person I truly hate. I knew it
was a set-up!
PATRICK
It wasn't like that.
KAT
Really? What was it like? A down
payment now, then a bonus for sleeping
with me?
PATRICK
I didn't care about the money.
He catches up to her now
PATRICK
(continuing)
I cared about --
She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than
in anger.
KAT
You are so not what I thought you were.
He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up. After a second,
she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.
Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching. She's
never looked more guilty.
INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a
blanket, watching ""Sixteen Candles"". When Molly Ringwald
leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream
date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an
infomercial
The phone sits next to her. Not ringing. Bianca breezes
in, bearing a cup of tea.
BIANCA
Are you sure you don't want to come
with us? It'll be fun.
Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.
KAT
I ' m sure .
Bianca sits down next to her
BIANCA
You looked beautiful last night, you
know.
KAT
So did you
Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL
rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron. He peeks his
head inside.
CAMERON
She okay?
BIANCA
I hope so.
The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.
WALTER
Was that your sister?
KAT
Yeah. She left with some bikers Big
ones. Full of sperm.
WALTER
Funny.
Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the
infomercial with Kat.
WALTER
(continuing)
I don't understand the allure of
dehydrated food. Is this something I
should be hip to?
KAT
No, Daddy.
WALTER
(dreading the
answer)
So tell me about this dance. Was it
fun?
KAT
Parts of it.
WALTER
Which parts?
KAT
The part where Bianca beat the hell out
of some guy.
WALTER
Bianca did what?
KAT
What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed
off on her?
WALTER
No -- impressed.
Kat looks up in surprise.
WALTER
(continuing)
You know, fathers don't like to admit
that their daughters are capable of
running their own lives. It means we've
become spectators. Bianca still lets me
play a few innings. You've had me on
the bleachers for years. When you go to
Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to
watch the game.
KAT
(hopeful)
When I go?
WALTER
Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've
changed your mind. I already sent 'em a
check.
Kat reaches over and gives him a hug
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes
from the food line.
CAMERON (0. S.)
Katarina?
She turns and looks at him
CAMERON
I'd like to express my apologies.
KAT
For what?
CAMERON
(looking down)
I didn't mean for you to get -- When
Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend,
I had no idea it would turn out so --
ugly. I would never have done anything
to compromise your - - -
He trails off when he realizes she's thrown her food tray
against the wall and marched off -- the old ""kill, kill""
look back in her eyes.
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Kat stomps up the hallway, full of menace
CLASSROOM - DAY
Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open
book in hand.
TEACHER
Who can tell me at what point Lucentio
admits his deception?
The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks
in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward
the hallway.
KAT
(to the teacher)
Family emergency.
HALLWAY - DAY
Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair
between two rows of lockers.
BIANCA
Let go!
KAT
You set me up.
BIANCA
I just wanted --
KAT
What? To completely damage me? To send
me to therapy forever? What?
BIANCA
No! I just wanted
Miss Perky walks up
MISS PERKY
Ladies? Shall we take a trip to my
office?
INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her,
then focuses on Bianca.
MISS PERKY
So you're the real bitch
BIANCA
Yes! Okay? Yes -- I'm the real bitch.
I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I
could. Apparently, this makes me a
horrible person. I'm sorry.
She turns to Kat.
BIANCA
(continuing)
I swear -- I didn't know about the
money. I didn't even know Joey was
involved. I would never intentionally
hurt you, Kat.
MISS PERKY
(to Kat)
Do you care to respond?
KAT
Am I supposed to feel better? Like,
right now? Or do I have some time to
think about it?
MISS PERKY
Just smack her now.
Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm.
BIANCA
(to Miss Perky)
We'll be getting back to you.
MISS PERKY
What, no hug?
HALLWAY - DAY
And Bianca leave Miss Perky's office
BIANCA
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or
is it just me?
KAT
It's just you.
ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
Mrs. Blaise faces the class
MRS. BLAISE
All right. I'm assuming everyone found
time to compose, their poems. Except for
Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.
Nerds in the back high-five each other.
MRS. BLAISE
(continuing)
Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?
No one moves. Then Kat slowly stands up.
KAT
I'11 go
Patrick looks up.
MRS. BLAISE
Oh, Lord.
She downs a couple Prozac
MRS. BLAISE
(continuing)
Please proceed.
Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath
before reading from her notebook.
KAT
I hate the way you talk to me/ and the
way you cut your hair/ I hate the way
you drive my car/ I hate it when you
stare.
She pauses, then continues
KAT
(continuing)
I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and
the way you read my mind/ I hate you so
much it makes me sick/ it even makes me
rhyme.
She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who
stares at the floor.
KAT
(continuing)
I hate the way you're always right/ I
hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you
make me laugh/ even worse when you make
me cry/ I hate it that you're not
around/ and the fact that you didn't
call/ But mostly I hate the way I don '
t hate you/ not even close, not even a
little bit, not even any at all.
She looks directly at Patrick. He looks back this time.
The look they exchange says everything.
Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains
in stunned silence.
EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's
greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the
front seat.
She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins
around.
Patrick stands there, smiling.
KAT
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
PATRICK
I thought you could use it. When you
start your band.
She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks closer.
PATRICK
(continuing)
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some
asshole paid me to take out a really
great girl.
KAT
Is that right?
PATRICK
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for
her.
Blushes and looks down.
PATRICK
(continuing)
You know -- it's not every day you find
a girl who'll flash her tits to get you
out of detention.
Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out
He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does
She lets him this time.
Then breaks it off
KAT
You can't just buy me a guitar every
time you screw up, you know.
He grimaces.
PATRICK
I know
He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.
KAT
And don't just think you can
He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.
STRATFORD HOUSE - SUNSET
We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
STRATFORD HOUSE/BACKYARD - SUNSET
Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers. Kat
watches.
KAT
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt
object on this grill?
PATRICK
Because I like to torture you.
KAT
Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman
yearbook?
PATRICK
Don ' t you even dare. . .
ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.
CAMERON
They do to!
BIANCA
They do not!
Rises to get the yearbook.
CAMERON
Can someone please tell her that
sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?
ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA
Severely making-out in a lawn chair. She comes up for a
breath.
MANDELLA
I can't remember a word of Shakespeare
right now. Isn't that weird?
Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND
PATRICK
She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca
now hands her.
KAT
You're freaked over this, aren't you?
Bianca hands her the yearbook
BIANCA
He's more than freaked. He's froke
Flips to a page.
KAT
I'd like to call your attention to
Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look
of 1995 ---
INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses,
bad hair, headgear -- the works.
She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes
and throws a handful of pretzels at her.
BIANCA
Patrick -- is that- a.
KAT
Perm?
PATRICK
Ask my attorney.
Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling -- as we
CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge
Family's ""I Think I Love You"".
FADE OUT:

FADE IN:
INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT TERMINAL - BAY
CLOSE ON A FACE. A nine year old boy, YOUNG COLE, his eyes wide
with wonder. watching something intently. We HEAR the sounds of
the P.A. SYSTEM droning Flight Information mingled with the
sounds of urgent SHOUTS, running FEET, EXCLAMATIONS.
YOUNG COLE'S POV: twenty yards away, a BLONDE MAN is sprawled on
the floor, blood oozing from his gaudy Hawaiian shirt.
A BRUNETTE in a tight dress, her face obscured from YOUNG COLE'S
view, rushes to the injured man, kneels beside him, ministering
to his wound.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, flanked by his PARENTS, their faces out of
view, as they steer him away.
FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
Come on, Son --this is no place for us.
YOUNG COLE resists momentarily, mesmerized by the drama.
YOUNG COLE'S POV: intermittently visible through a confusion of
FIGURES rushing through the foreground, the BLONDE MAN reaching
up and touching the cheek of the kneeling BRUNETTE in a gesture
of enormous tenderness, a gesture of farewell, while the P.A.
SYSTEM continues its monotonous monotone...
P.A. SYSTEM
Flight 784 for San Francisco is now
ready for boarding at inmate number
66578, Greely.
INT. PRISON DORMITORY/FUTURE - ETERNAL NIGHT
PRISON P.A. SYSTEM
--number 5429, Garcia -- number 87645, Cole...
COLE, late thirties, dark hair, comes awake in a bunk cage, one
of many stacked four high along both sides of a long dim
corridor. He blinks in the near dark, shaken, disoriented.
Then, as he ""recovers"" from his very vivid dream, WE GET OUR
FIRST LOOK AT HIS ENVIRONMENT...A WINDOWLESS UNDERGROUND WORLD OF
ETERNAL NIGHT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE...AN ALMOST COLORLESS
""REALITY"" OF BLURRED EDGES AND ECHOEY SOUNDS, MUCH MORE
""DREAMLIKE"" THAN HIS DREAM.
Flashlights glare. In the half-light, COLE sees spooky figures,
GUARDS, moving among the locked bunk/cages.
COLE turns and whispers to the occupant of the next cage, JOSE...
COLE
Ssssst! Jose, what's going on?
JOSE's face is almost lost in shadow. What there is of it is
youthful. He's just a scared Puerto Rican kid!
JOSE
""Volunteers"" again.
JOSE immediately rolls over and feigns sleep as SCARFACE, a
menacing guard with a jagged scar running down his cheek, looms
close to COLE's cage and unlocks it.
SCARFACE
""Volunteer duty"".
The PRISONERS in the other cages watch silently with narrowed eyes.
COLE
I didn't volunteer.
SCARFACE
You causing trouble again?
COLE
(controls his temper)
No trouble.
INT. EQUIPMENT ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT
COLE's alone, struggling to get into what looks like a space suit
in a room where suits hang like ghosts with blank eyes.
TITLES BEGIN SUPERED OVER THE SCENE
COLE has the torso of the suit on now and is trying to close it.
OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
All openings must be closed.
COLE looks for the source of the voice, a tiny grate in the wall.
OFFSCREEN VOICE (o.s.)
If the integrity of the suit is compromised
in any way, if the fabric is torn or a zipper
not closed, readmittance will be denied.
INT. SEALED CHAMBER - MINUTES LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
COLE, wearing the ""space suit"" and a helmet with a plastic visor,
steps into a tiny chamber, a kind of air lock. The heavy door
clangs shut behind him. He's alone. COLE'S breath comes quicker
now as he sucks oxygen from the air tanks on his back.
On the opposite wall is another door with a huge wheel lock.
COLE turns the heavy wheel, opens the door, steps through It
INT. ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
COLE'S in an ascending elevator that groans and creaks. He looks
down at a crudely drawn map he holds in his gloved hand.
The map shows a series of tunnels and ladders.
INT. SEWER PIPE - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
COLE pans a flashlight, probing the filthy sewer he's wading through
RATS flee the blade of light, scurry across islands of rusting junk.
The flashlight beam settles on a ladder mounted in the wall.
Reaching the rusted ladder, COLE starts to climb awkwardly.
EXT. CITY STREET/FUTURE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
A SCRAPING NOISE as a heavy man-hole cover is pushed up and moved
aside. COLE'S helmeted head emerges from below.
COLE'S POV THROUGH HIS PLASTIC-VISORED HELMET: a city in
moonlight! A surreal image of abandoned buildings. No people
anywhere. The only sounds are the WIND and COLE'S BREATHING.
EXT. ANOTHER CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
COLE'S light reveals abandoned vine-covered automobiles.
Moving to the nearest car, COLE searches in the vines for
something. Finds it. An insect.
COLE takes the bug in his gloved hand. As he clumsily inserts it
into a collection tube, something makes him turn.
There's something across the street in the dark. Something alive.
COLE points his flashlight and reveals...a BEAR! Startled by the
light, the animal blinks, then stands on its rear legs and ROARS.
ANGLE ON COLE, staring wide-eyed.
Then, the BEAR sinks down onto all fours and, trying to avoid the
flashlight, it pads quickly down the street.
INT. SUBTERRANEAN PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
Using the flashlight to see, COLE reaches down to the cracked
floor and gets another specimen. DOGSHIT!
The only sound is COLE'S labored BREATHING.
Then, a different SOUND. GRRRR! A dog. More GRRRRS. More
dogs. Then, a YIP. Then, VICIOUS GROWLS. It's a DOGFIGHT!
EXT. STREET - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
A giant OWL, perched on an overhead traffic light, raises its wings
and lifts off...rising higher and higher into the brightening sky.
Below, on the street, COLE trudges along, passing deserted
buildings, windows broken, rusted signs dangling.
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT (FIRST LIGHT)
COLE'S light reveals a spider web just inside the store. A large
SPIDER tries to hide from the light.
COLE reaches carefully into the web and plucks the spider and
puts it into one of his specimen tubes.
Then, he shines his light all around the once elegant store. There's
nothing but aisle after aisle of moldering consumer goods.
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAWN
As COLE comes out of the store, the first rays of the sun hit the
building. COLE stops, squints into the light through his visor.
COLE'S POV: spray-painted on the wall a long time ago is a stenciled
logo of twelve monkeys holding hands in a circle. Over it is
written, ""WE DID IT!""
COLE looks up.
COLE'S POV: high up on a building across the street, a LION
patrols a ledge, pauses, looks out majestically over his world.
TTTLES END
INT. FIRST UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
ROARING WATER, powerful torrents gushing from nozzles in the
wall, pummel the still-suited COLE.
INT. SECOND UNDERGROUND DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
Stark naked and shivering, COLE is being scrubbed with brushes on
long poles (like the ones used to wash cars) wielded by two HULKING
FIGURES in bulky decontamination suits, their personas lost in their
windowed masks. It's a grim scene in a grim cement room with damp,
dripping walls. From an unseen source comes an AMPLIFIED VOICE,
AMPLIFIED VOICE (o.s.)
Raise your arms above your head.
COLE lifts his arms and the FIGURES start scrubbing his armpits.
INT. TINY CHAMBER - SHORTLY (ETERNAL NIGHT)
Still naked, COLE is seated on a stool while a MASKED TECHNICIAN
in a less elaborate, less bulky decontamination outfit draws
blood from COLE'S arm with an old-fashioned hypodermic needle.
COLE glances toward a single, nearly opaque ""window"" of thick
plastic in the rusty iron wall. VAGUE FIGURES seem to lurk
behind the translucent aperture, studying him.
The TECHNICIAN slips the blood sample through a slot in the wall.
INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - ETERNAL NIGHT
Ushered in by two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, COLE looks around.
COLE'S POV: wails hidden by old headlines, articles, maps, charts...
a blackboard covered with elaborate, sophisticated formulae...surfaces
heaped with cracked monitors, gerry-rigged computers held together with
string, lasers lost in tangles of cable, ancient tube amplifiers, a
dilapidated cardboard reconstruction of a city, stacks of moldering
books and tattered computer printouts...and, seated at a long conference
table, staring at COLE, six SCIENTISTS: an ASTROPHYSICIST, ENGINEER,
BOTANIST, MICROBIOLOGIST, ZOOLOGIST, and a GEOLOGIST. They represent
a ""modern"" science where brilliant new ideas interface with crude,
outdated, patched-together technologies.
TINY
James Cole. Cleared from quarantine.
MICROBIOLOGIST
Thank you. You two wait outside.
SCARFACE
He's got a history, Doctor. Violence.
COLE'S eyes return to the walls.
Headlines: ""CLOCK TICKING! NO CURE YET!""
SCARFACE
Anti-social six -- doing 25 to life.
ENGINEER
I don't think he's going to hurt us. You're
not going to hurt us, are you Mr. Cole?
COLE'S head turns quickly to the ENGINEER.
COLE
No, sir.
The GUARDS exchange a look, shrug, exit, closing the door.
MICROBIOLOGIST
Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole.
COLE goes to the empty chair at the conference table, sits down.
ASTROPHYSICIST
We want you to tell us about last
night.
COLE
I went to the surface and I collected
specimens like I was told.
The SCIENTISTS don't say anything. They just study him carefully.
COLE
(worried)
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
MICROBIOLOGIST
We'll get to the spider later, Mr.
Cole. Right now, we want to know
everything that you saw.
INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER (ETERNAL NIGHT)
COLE, starting to look very tired now, stands at the blackboard
sketching a detailed map of exactly where he was last night.
ASTPOPHYSICIST
Where you collected sample #4, what
street was that?
COLE
Uh...
BOTANIST
It's important to observe everything.
COLE
I think it was...I'm sure it was 2nd Street.
As the SCIENTISTS start to whisper animatedly among themselves,
COLE'S eyes drift across the newspaper clippings taped to the
wall. One headline screams, ""VIRUS MUTATING!"" Another features
a photo of an OLD MAN (DR. MASON, who we'll see again later on)
and the words, SCIENTIST SAYS, ""IT'S TOO LATE FOR CURE"".
ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
Close your eyes, Cole.
Startled, COLE closes his eyes obediently.
BLACKNESS. Like COLE, WE SEE NOTHING. But we HEAR their VOICES.
ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
Tell us in detail what you've seen in
this room.
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
Uh, in this room? Uh...
MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
How many of us are there?
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
Six...seven, if you count me.
ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
Tell us about the pictures on the wall...
COLE'S VOICE (o.s.)
Uh, you mean the newspapers?
A MONTAGE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES (o.s.)
Tell us about the newspapers. Can you
hear my voice? What do I look like?
What does he look like, the man who
just spoke? How old were you when you
left the surface?
The VOICES blur into a cacophony and FADE INTO the droning P.A.
SYSTEM at the airport.
INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY
THE DREAM AGAIN! But at an earlier moment. YOUNG COLE, flanked
by his PARENTS, whose faces are out of view, is watching a PLANE
land through one of the big glass windows that lines the concourse
leading to the departure gates.
P.A. SYSTEM (o.s.)
Flight 784 now boarding at gate...
Suddenly, a SHOUT, followed by raised VOICES, interrupts the
monotonous airport routine. As YOUNG COLE and his PARENTS turn
to see what's going on, a man we'll call MR. PONYTAIL, his face
averted, hurries past them, bumping YOUNG COLE with a Chicago
Hulls Sports Duffle Bag.
MR. PONYTAIL
WATCH IT!
YOUNG COLE sees little more than the gaudy pants, the duffle, and
the man's ponytail flopping as he rushes towards the gates.
Just then, a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out, ""NOOOOOOOOO!""
YOUNG COLE turns back toward the Security Check Point just as
TRAVELERS scatter madly, some diving to the floor, others
running. A TERRIFIED TRAVELER, hitting the floor close by, looks
up at YOUNG COLE with panicky eyes, and asks....
TERRIFIED TRAVELER
Just exactly why did you volunteer?
INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE/FUTURE WORLD - (ETERNAL NIGHT)
COLE comes abruptly awake. Seated now, he's facing the SCIENTISTS.
ASTROPHYSICIST
Wake up, Cole.
COLE
Uh, I didn't hear the...
MICROBIOLOGIST
(tapping a pencil on the table)
I asked you, why did you volunteer?
COLE
Well, the guard woke me up. He told me
I volunteered.
The SCIENTISTS react, whispering urgently among themselves.
COLE starts to nod off again, then comes awake with a start as
the ENGINEER speaks to him.
ENGINEER
We appreciate you volunteering. You're
a very good observer, Cole.
COLE
Uh, thank you.
ENGINEER
You'll get a reduction in sentence.
COLE keeps his face impassive.
ASTROPHYSICIST
To be determined by the proper authorities.
ENGINEER
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction,
do you, Cole? Have it taken away?
COLE
No, sir!
ASTROPHYSICIST
We have a very advanced program, something
very different, requires very skilled people.
MICROBIOLOGIST
An opportunity to reduce your sentence
considerably...
ZOOLOGIST
And possibly play an important role in
returning the human race to the surface
of the earth.
ENGINEER
We want tough minded people. Strong
mentally. We've had some...misfortunes
with ""unstable"" types.
ASTROPHYSICIST
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
BOTANIST
Not to volunteer could be a real mistake.
MICROBIOLOGIST
(tapping his pencil again)
Definitely a mistake!
COLE gives away nothing. He's in a box here. He has no choices.
He stares at the tapping pencil.
INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT
A strikingly ""real"" world of bright colors. Extravagant paintings
adorn the walls. A POET, tiny and ruddy faced, squints over his
glasses as he reads in a booming voice to an AUDIENCE of thirty
seated on folding chairs.
POET
Still among the myriad microwaves, the
infra-red messages, the gigabytes of ones
and zeroes, we find words, infinitesimally
small, byte-sized now, tinier even than
science lurking in some vague electricity
where, if we listen we can hear the solitary
voice of that poet telling us,
""We are no other than a moving row
Of Magic shadow-shapes that come and go
Round with the Sun-illumined Lantern hold
In Midnight by the Master of the show.""
As the POET reads, we STUDY the audience, mostly YUPPIE CULTURE
JUNKIES or BOHEMIANS. Among them, a light-haired woman of twenty-
eight, soberly dressed, wearing glasses. She's KATHRYN RAILLY. And
it's her beeper that suddenly BEEPS. BEEP! BEEP!
POET'S VOICE (o.s.)
""The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.""
BEEP! BEEP! Scowling at the outrageous interruption, the POET
looks up from the text just as RAILLY, tumbling, shuts off the
beeper and rises, embarrassed. As she makes her way to an exit,
the glaring POET continues...
POET
""Yesterday This Day's Madness did prepare;
Tomorrow's Silence, Triumph or Despair:
Drink! for you know not whence you came, nor why:
Drink! for you know not why you go, nor where.""
INT. CORRIDOR/POLICE STATION - NIGHT
DETECTIVE FRANKI leads RAILLY past crowded holding cells.
FRANKI
-- so they get there and they ask the guy
real nice for some kind of i.d., and he gets
agitated, starts screaming about viruses.
Totally irrational, totally disoriented,
doesn't know where he is, what day it is,
alla that stuff. All they got was his
name. They figure he's stoned out of
his mind, it's some kinda psychotic
episode, so they're gonna bring him...
RAILLY
He's been tested for drugs?
FRANKI
Negative for drugs. But he took on
five cops like he was dusted to the
eyeballs. No drugs. You believe that?
FRANKI pauses, indicating a tiny observation window of thick meshed
glass in an otherwise solid door, and RAILLY looks through it.
RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW: a MAN, his back to her, in
strait-jacket and prison denims, examining the wall of the padded
cell with the distorted intensity of a ""mental case"".
RAILLY
You have him in restraints.
FRANKI
Were you listening? We got two officers in
the hospital. Yeah, he's in restraints, plus
the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill
a horse. Look at him! Still on his feet.
RAILLY'S POV THROUGH THE WINDOW: the MAN in the cell turns, looks
right at her. In spite of the cuts and welts, it's clearly COLE.
RAILLY
That would explain the bruises, I
guess. The struggle.
FRANKI
You want to go in? Examine him?
RAILLY
Yes, please. You said he gave a name...
FRANKI
(unlocking the door)
James Cole. That's everything we got. None
of the James Coles on the computer match him.
No license, no prints, no warrants. Nothing.
You want me to go in with you?
RAILLY
(entering)
No, thank you.
FRANKI
I'll be right here...just in case.
INT. ISOLATION CELL
COLE stares at RAILLY. The environment is intensely real...vivid
colors...each sound, however slight, very distinct, almost loud...
and yet she appears to him almost like a vision.
RAILLY
Mr. Cole? My name is Doctor Railly.
I'm a psychiatrist. I work for the
County -- I don't work for the police.
My only concern is your well being --
do you understand that?
COLE
I need to go now.
RAILLY
I'm going to be completely honest. I'm
not going to lie to you. I can't make
the police let you go...but I do want
to help you. And I want you to trust
me. Can you do that, James? May I
call you ""James""?
COLE
""James""! Nobody ever calls me that.
RAILLY
(frowns, studies him)
Have you been a patient at County?
Have I seen you someplace?
COLE
No, not possible. Listen, I have to
get out of here. I'm supposed to be
getting information.
RAILLY
What kind of information?
COLE
It won't help you. You can't do anything
about it. You can't change anything.
RAILLY
Change what?
COLE
I need to go.
RAILLY
Do you know why you're here, James.
COLE
Because I'm a good observer. Because I
have a tough mind.
RAILLY
I see. You don't remember assaulting a
police officer...several officers?
COLE
They wanted identification. I don't have
any identification. I wasn't trying to
hurt them.
RAILLY
You don't have a driver's license,
James? Or a Social Security card?
COLE
No.
RAILLY
Why not? Most people have some ID.
COLE
You wouldn't understand.
RAILLY
You've been in an institution, haven't
you, James? A hospital?
COLE
I have to go.
RAILLY
A jail? Prison?
COLE
Underground.
RAILLY
Hiding?
COLE
I love this air. This is wonderful air.
RAILLY
What's wonderful about the air, James?
COLE
It's so clean. No germs.
RAILLY
You're afraid of germs?
COLE
I have to go.
RAILLY
Why do you think there aren't any germs
in the air, James?
COLE
This is April, right?
RAILLY
July.
COLE
(sudden panic)
July?!
RAILLY
Do you know what year it is?
COLE
What year is it?
RAILLY
What year do you think it is?
COLE
1995?
RAILLY
You think it's July of 1995? That's
the future, James. Do you think you're
living in the future?
COLE
(slightly confused)
No, 1995 is the past.
RAILLY
1995 is the future, James. This is 1989.
COLE looks stunned.
INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - MORNING
COLE, bound tightly by the strait-jacket, heavy manacles on his
ankles, is being escorted down the corridor by two surly POLICEMEN.
COLE
Where are you taking me?
POLICEMAN #1
South of France, buddy. Fancy hotel.
You're gonna love it.
COLE
South of France?! I don't want to go
to the South of France. I want to make
a telephone call.
POLICEMAN #2 smirks as he unlocks a heavy steel door.
POLICEMAN #2
Zip it, scumbag -- you fooled the shrink
with your act, but you don't fool us.
Then, POLICEMAN #2 swings the steel door open and sunlight
overwhelms COLE, blinding him in a dazzling fury of white light.
EXT. CITY STREET/MINI-VAN - DAY
A Mini-van, the kind of vehicle used to transport a half dozen
prisoners, crawls through a busy street. The Police Department
logo is prominent on the side of the van beneath barred windows.
INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL/SHOWERS - AN HOUR LATER (MORNING)
Fierce spray recalls the decontamination in the future. COLE
stands stark naked under the shower while two muscular attendants,
PALMER and BILLINGS, supervise.
As PALMER shuts off the water, BILLINGS hands COLE a towel and
starts inspecting his scalp...
BILLINGS
Lemme see your head, Jimbo, see if you
got any creepy crawlies.
COLE
I need to make a telephone call.
BILLINGS
(pulling Cole's head)
Gotta work that out with a doctor, Jimbo.
Can't make no calls 'til the doctor says.
COLE
It's very important.
BILLINGS
What chew gotta do, Jimbo, is take it
easy, relax into things. We all gonna
get along fine if you just relax.
COLE gets the hint of menace in the message and submits to the
lice inspection, only his eyes revealing his frustration.
INT. HOSPITAL/DAYROOM - HALF AN HOUR LATER (DAY)
COLE stands in the doorway, stunned by his first sight of the
large room. His eyes go to the heavily-grilled windows where
light pours in from outside. Then, to the TV, where a CARTOON
COMMERCIAL makes raucous noises.
PATIENTS, in K-Mart street clothes or ratty robes, stare gloomily
at the TV, or play cards, pace, or just stare blankly.
BILLINGS is at COLE'S side, beckoning to a patient, JEFFREY MASON,
a twenty year old white youth dressed in khakis and a plaid shirt.
BILLINGS
Jeffrey. Yo! Jeffrey. This here is James.
Whyncha show James around? Tell him the TV
rules, show him the games an' stuff, okay?
JEFFREY
(with a sly look)
How much you gonna pay me? Huh? I'd
be doing your job.
BILLINGS
Five thousand dollars, my man. That
enough? I'll wire it to your account
as usual, okay?
JEFFREY
Okay, Billings. Five thousand. That's
enough. Five thousand dollars. I'll
give him the Deluxe Mental Hospital Tour.
As BILLINGS walks away chuckling, JEFFREY turns to COLE.
JEFFREY
Kid around, kid around. It makes them feel
good, we're all pals. We're prisoners, they're
the guards, but it's all in good fun, you see?
COLE nods and JEFFREY indicates card tables where PATIENTS are
playing cards, checkers, chess, or working on jig saw puzzles.
JEFFREY
Here's the games. Games vegitize you.
If you play the games, you're
voluntarily taking a tranquilizer.
COLE sees a partially completed puzzle of the well-known painting,
THE PEACEABLE KINGDOM, depicting a serene world of animals in harmony.
JEFFREY
What'd they give you? Thorazine? How
much? Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
COLE
I need to make a telephone call.
JEFFREY
A telephone call? That's communication
with the outside world! Doctor's
discretion. Hey, if alla these nuts
could just make phone calls, it could
spread. Insanity oozing through telephone
cables, oozing into the ears of all those
poor sane people, infecting them! Whackos
everywhere! A plague of madness.
(suddenly sly and confidential)
In fact, very few of us here are actually
mentally ill. I'm not saying you're
not mentally ill, for all I know you're
crazy as a loon. But that's not why
you're here. Why you're here is because
of the system, because of the economy.
(indicating the TV)
There's the TV. It's all right there.
Commercials. We are not productive
anymore, they don't need us to make
things anymore, it's all automated. What
are we for then? We're consumers. Okay,
buy a lot of stuff, you're a good citizen.
But if you don't buy a lot of stuff, you
know what? You're mentally ill! That's
a fact! If you don't buy things...toilet
paper, new cars, computerized blenders,
electrically operated sexual devices...
(getting hysterical)
SCREWDRIVERS WITH MINIATURE BUILT-IN
RADAR DEVICES, STEREO SYSTEMS WITH
BRAIN IMPLANTED HEADPHONES, VOICE-
ACTIVATED COMPUTERS, AND...
A woman orderly, TERRY, turns from the feeble PATIENT she's helping.
TERRY
Take it easy, Jeffrey. Be calm.
Abruptly, JEFFREY stifles his hysteria, takes a deep breath and
continues, completely calm now. But COLE isn't listening. He's
mesmerized by the TV.
JEFFREY
So if you want to watch a particular
program, say ""All My Children"" or
something, you go to the Charge Nurse
and tell her what day and time the show
you want to see is on. But you have to
tell her before the show is scheduled
to be on. There was this one guy who
was always requesting shows that had already
played. He couldn't quite grasp the
idea that the Charge Nurse couldn't
just make it be yesterday for him, turn
back time ha ha. What a fruitcake!!
This last thought actually penetrates COLE'S focus on the TV and
he turns to JEFFREY who's picking up speed again.
JEFFREY
Seriously, more and more people are
being defined now as mentally ill. Why?
Because they're not consuming on their
own. But as patients, they becone
consumers of mental health care. And
this gives the so-called sane people work!
(hysteria again)
WHOOO! SHOCK THERAPY! GROUP THERAPY!
HALLUCINATIONS! THERAPEUTIC DRUGS!
IGGIDY DIGGIDY DIG! PERFECT! THE
SYSTEM IN HARMONY LIKE A BIG MACHINE...
TERRY
Okay, that's it, Jeffrey, you're gonna
get a shot. I warned you...
JEFFREY
(calming himself, smiling)
Right! Right! Carried away, heh heh.
I got ""carried away"". Explaining the
workings of...the institution.
Just then, TJ WASHINGTON, a somber-looking African American in a
bathrobe, taps COLE on the shoulder.
TJ WASHINGTON
I don't really come from outer space.
JEFFREY
This is TJ Washington, Jim -- he
doesn't really come from outer space.
TJ WASHINGTON
Don't mock me, my friend.
(to Cole)
It's a condition of ""mental divergence"".
I find myself on another planet, Ogo,
part of an intellectual elite, preparing
to subjugate barbarian hordes on Pluto.
But even though it's a totally convincing
reality in every way...I can feel, breathe,
hear...nevertheless, Ogo is actually a
construct of my psyche. I am mentally
divergent in that I am escaping certain
unnamed realities that plague my life
here. When I stop going there, I will
be well. Are you also divergent, friend?
The P.A. SYSTEM interrupts, startling COLE.
P.A. SYSTEM (v.o.)
James Cole. Report to Staff. James Cole!
JEFFREY
Staff! Whoo! Time for Staff. Now the
geniuses cure you. Hallelujah!
INT. PSYCH WARD CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
COLE is agitated, speaking forcefully.
COLE
This is a place for crazy people! I'm
not crazy!
RAILLY, four other PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS, including RAILLY'S best
friend, MARILOU MARTIN, and their chief, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, sit
around a beat-up conference table, watching COLE, who sits facing
the doctors, with BILLINGS looming behind him. (Some of the DOCTORS
bear a strong resemblance to the SCIENTISTS OF THE FUTURE.)
RESIDENT #1
We don't use that term...""crazy"", Mr. Cole.
COLE
Well, you've got some real nuts in here!
Listen to me, all of you -- I have to
tell you something that's going to be
difficult for you to understand, but...
DR. RAILLY
James...please. These are all doctors
here and we want to help you.
DR. FLETCHER
Mr. Cole -- last night you told Dr.
Railly you thought it was...
(checking a file)
1995. ... How about right now? Do you
know what year it is right now?
COLE
1989. Look, I'm not confused. There's been
a mistake, I've been sent to the wrong place.
Suddenly, COLE reaches out and BILLINGS lunges forward, but COLE
is just grabbing a pad and pencil.
COLE
Hey, I'm not going to hurt anybody.
FLETCHER restrains BILLINGS with a hand signal.
COLE
(drawing)
Do any of you know anything about the
Army of the Twelve Monkeys? They paint
this, stencil it, on buildings, all
over the place.
COLE waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.
DR. CASEY
Mr. Cole...
COLE
Right. I guess you wouldn't, this is
1989, they're probably not active yet.
That makes sense! Okay. Listen to me,
three billion people died in 1995.
Three billion, got that? Almost
the whole population. Of the world!
Only about one percent survived.
DOCTORS exchange knowing looks. This is an old story, apparently.
RESIDENT #2
Are you going to save us, Mr. Cole?
COLE
Save you? How can I save you? It
already happened! I can't save you. I'm
simply trying to get some information for
people in the present so that someday...
(sees their eyes)
You don't believe me. You think I'm
crazy. But I'm not crazy. I'm a convict,
sure, I have a quick temper, but I'm as
sane as anyone in this room. I...
COLE stops, sees DR. FLETCHER tapping his pencil. COLE'S seen
that tapping before -- in the future! It disorients him.
DR. RAILLY
Can you tell us the name of the prison
you've come from?
COLE doesn't answer. He's staring at the tapping pencil.
DR. FLETCHER
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
COLE
(recovering, new tack)
No! Look, I don't belong here! What I
need to do is make a telephone call to
straighten everything out.
DR. FLETCHER
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would
straighten everything out?
COLE
Scientists. I'm supposed to report in
to them. They'll want to know they
sent me to the wrong time.
DR. FLETCHER
So you could talk to these scientists
and they do what? Send you to the future?
COLE
No, no. I can't talk to them. It's called,
""voice mail"". I'm supposed to leave messages.
They monitor it from the present.
RESIDENT #2
""From the present."" We're not in the
present now, Mr. Cole?
COLE
No, no. This is the past. This has
already happened. Listen...
RESIDENT #3
Mr. Cole, you belong in 1995 -- that's
the present, is that it?
COLE
No, 1995 is the past, too. Look...
DR. FLETCHER
These scientists, Mr. Cole? Are they
doctors like ourselves?
Two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.
COLE
No! I mean yes, but... Look, I've been given
a lot of drugs but I'm still perfectly lucid.
You have to let me use the phone. One call!
COLE looks desperately toward RAILLY, pleading eyes meeting hers.
INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT - DAY
Four little KIDS SCREAM and SQUABBLE while the phone CHIRPS
insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried MOTHER
lunges for the phone, answers sharply...
MOTHER
Yes?
(listens, frowns, then)
Whaaaaat? ""Voice mail""! I don't know
what you're talkin' about. ... Is this
a joke? I don't know any scientists.
James who? Never heard of you!
The MOTHER slams down the phone.
INT. RAILLY'S OFFICE/COUNTY HOSPITAL - DAY
A dismayed COLE still has the receiver in his hand. Sympathetically,
RAILLY takes it from him.
RAILLY
It wasn't who you expected?
COLE is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset. Nuts?
COLE
It was some lady. She didn't know anything.
RAILLY
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
COLE
No. That's the reason they chose me --
I remember things.
RAILLY frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest.
It's clear COLE is becoming a special patient and RAILLY'S cool,
detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.
RAILLY
James, where did you grow up? Was it
around here? Around Baltimore?
COLE
(lost in thought)
What?
RAILLY
I have the...strangest feeling I've met
you before...a long time ago, perhaps.
Were you ever...?
COLE
Wait! This is only 1989! I'm supposed
to be leaving messages in 1995. It's
not the right number yet. That's the
problem. Damn! How can I contact them?
RAILLY recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle,
pours out some tablets, and holds them out to COLE.
RAILLY
James, take these.
(watching him step back)
Please -- I helped you like I said I
would. Now I want you to trust me.
INT. AIRPORT CONCOURSE - DAY (THE DREAM)
MR. PONYTAIL races past the startled YOUNG COLE.
MR. PONYTAIL
WATCH IT!
Was it JEFFREY wearing gaudy pants and a ponytail? It was
definitely JEFFREY'S VOICE.
TRAVELERS dive for cover as a WOMAN'S VOICE cries out...
WOMAN'S VOICE
NOOOOOOOOOO!
The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks up at YOUNG COLE, makes eye contact, but
doesn't speak. The TERRIFIED TRAVELER looks a lot like DR. FLETCHER!
Just then, YOUNG COLE is distracted by a running figure. It's
the BLONDE MAN in the Hawaiian shirt, but he's not injured. He's
sprinting toward the gates, glancing back over his shoulder, his
moustache slightly askew!
A sharp CRACK of a GUNSHOT rings out! Then, DAZZLING LIGHT.
Everything goes white!
INT. DORMITORY (PSYCH WARD)/COUNTY HOSPITAL - NIGHT
COLE'S eyes blink awake, blinded by a flashlight.
He's lying in one of thirty beds in a darkened ward. Disoriented.
Which world is this? The room is full of BREATHING, SNORING,
occasional MOANS. He can barely discern the shadowy figures of
an ORDERLY and a NURSE, making their rounds, checking each bed.
His eyes adjusting to the darkness, COLE watches them exit.
He turns and sees a patch of moonlight coming in a barred window.
With a quick glance at the sleeping PATIENTS, he slips out of
bed, makes his way stealthily to the window, peers out.
COLE'S POV: the moon, glowing in the sky, illuminating a single
tree. Under the tree, in silhouette, a COUPLE embraces, kisses.
ANGLE ON COLE, looking out the window, absorbed.
VOICE (o.s.)
It won't work. You can't open it.
Alarmed, COLE turns, sees JEFFREY in the next bed.
JEFFREY
You think you can remove the grill but
you can't. It's welded.
COLE checks the grill anyway.
JEFFREY
See? I toldja. And all the doors are
locked, too. They're protecting the
people on the outside from us. But the
people outside are as crazy as us.
COLE has become preoccupied with a small SPIDER creeping along
the window sill. He's staring at it when he's distracted by a
sudden SOUND. Grabbing the SPIDER, COLE scrambles back into bed
just as the door opens and an ORDERLY probes the dark room with
the blade of his flashlight.
ANGLE ON COLE, in bed, feigning sleep.
The flashlight clicks off and COLE hears the door close.
For a long moment the ward is silent except for BREATHING,
SNORES, occasional MOANS. Then, COLE hears JEFFREY'S hoarse
whisper, picking up right where he left off.
JEFFREY
You know what ""crazy"" is? ""crazy"" is
""majority rules"". Take germs for example.
Although COLE is preoccupied with the SPIDER struggling to get
out of his fist, he can't help reacting to the word, ""germs""!
COLE
Germs?!
JEFFREY
In the 18th century there was no such
thing! Nobody'd ever imagined such a
thing -- no sane person anyway. Along
comes this doctor...Semmelweiss, I
think. He tries to convince people...
other doctors mostly...that there are
these teeny tiny invisible ""bad things""
called germs that get into your body and
make you...sick! He's trying to get
doctors to wash their hands. What is
this guy...crazy? Teeny tiny invisible
whaddayou call 'em?...""germs""!
As JEFFREY warms to his subject, getting excited, COLE tries to
figure out where to put the SPIDER.
JEFFREY (cont.)
So cut to the 20th century! Last week
in fact, right before I got dragged
into this hellhole. I order a burger
in this fast food joint. The waiter
drops it on the floor. He picks it up,
wipes it off, hands it to me...like it
was all okay.
No alternative. COLE pops the SPIDER in his mouth and swallows
it as JEFFREY prattles on...
JEFFREY
""What about the germs?"" I say. He
goes, ""I don't believe in germs. Germs
are just a plot they made up so they
can sell you disinfectants and soap!""
Now, he's crazy, right? Hey, you
believe in germs, don't you?
COLE
I'm not crazy.
JEFFREY
Of course not, I never thought you were.
You want to escape, right? That's very
sane. I can help you. You want me to,
don't you? Get you out?
COLE
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
JEFFREY
Why don't I escape, that's what you
were going to ask me, right? 'Cause
I'd be crazy to escape! I'm all taken
care of, see? I've sent out word.
COLE
What's that mean?
JEFFREY
I've managed to contact certain underlings,
evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and
assorted minions, who will contact my father.
When he learns I'm in this kind of place,
he'll have them transfer me to one of those
classy joints where they treat you...properly.
LIKE A GUEST! LIKE A PERSON! SHEETS!
TOWELS! LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS
FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
PATIENTS are waking up as the NURSE and two ORDERLIES burst into the
dorm and head straight for JEFFREY who's struggling to calm himself.
JEFFREY
Sorry. Really sorry. Got a little
agitated. The thought of escaping
crossed my mind and suddenly...suddenly
I felt LIKE BENDING THE FUCKING BARS
BACK, RIPPING OFF THE GODDAMN WINDOW
FRAMES AND...EATING THEM, YES, EATING
THEM, AND LEAPING, LEAPING...
COLE watches the ORDERLIES grab JEFFREY and haul him away.
JEFFREY
You dumb assholes! I'm a mental patient!
I'm supposed to act out. Wait til you
morons find out who I am. My father's
gonna be really upset. AND WHEN MY
FATHER GETS UPSET, THE GROUND SHAKES!
MY FATHER IS GOD! I WORSHIP MY FATHER.
INT. WARD DAYROOM - MORNING
ANGLE ON TV SCREEN/A VIDEO IMAGE OF A LAB MONKEY, convulsing
pathetically, a victim of shocks from the numerous wires attached
to his tiny, restrained body.
ANGLE ON COLE, sitting, writing intensely in a magazine with
crayon, surrounded by dull-eyed PATIENTS in pajamas and ratty
robes, staring at the shuddering LAB MONKEY on the TV screen.
JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
Torture! Experiments! We're all
monkeys
COLE locks up, startled, as JEFFREY, one eye bruised black, takes
the seat next to him.
COLE
They hurt you!
JEFFREY
Not as bad as what they're doing to
kitty.
ANGLE ON TV, showing a laboratory CAT turning in mad circles,
eating its own tail, while a NEWS REPORTER narrates.
TV NEWS REPORTER (v.o.)
These video tapes were obtained by
animal rights activists who worked
underground as laboratory assistants
for several months. Authorities say
there is little they can do until...
The video footage now shows LAB WORKERS watching the results of
their experiments passively.
ANGLE ON COLE, reacting angrily.
COLE
Look at those assholes, they're asking
for it! Maybe people deserved to be
wiped out!
JEFFREY
(startled, turning)
Wiping cut the human race! That's a
great idea! But it's more of a long
term thing -- right now we have to
focus on more immediate goals.
(sudden whisper)
I didn't say a word about ""you know
what"".
COLE
What are you talking about???
JEFFREY
You know -- your plan.
As COLE stares, befuddled, JEFFREY sees COLE'S magazine.
JEFFREY
What're you writing? You a reporter?
COLE
(shielding the magazine)
It's private.
JEFFREY
A lawsuit? You going to sue them?
Just then BILLINGS looms over COLE, extending a cup full of pills.
BILLINGS
Yo, James -- time to take your meds.
INT. DAY ROOM/HOSPITAL - THIRTY MINUTES LATER (MORNING)
ANGLE ON THE TV, a commercial playing: a beautiful couple romps
in the surf in slow motion while an eager NARRATOR encourages...
NARRATOR (v.o.)
Take a chance. Live the moment. Sunshine.
Gorgeous beaches. The Florida Keys!
ANGLE ON COLE, very drugged, seated in front of the TV along with
other drugged PATIENTS, staring at the screen.
ANGLE ON THE TV, showing a picture of the Marx Brothers.
TV AWNOUNCER (v.o.)
We'll return to the Marx Brothers in
""Monkey Business"" following these
messages.
JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
Monkey Business! Monk Key Business.
COLE sees JEFFREY sliding into the next chair and smirking.
JEFFREY
Get it? Monk - Key. Monk!
(big grin)
Key!
JEFFREY flashes his palm open for one quick moment. A KEY!
COLE
(groggy)
What....???
JEFFREY
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro.
Major load! Listen up -- try and get
it together. Focus! Focus! The plan!
Remember? I did my part.
COLE
What...???
JEFFREY
Not, ""what"", babe! When!
""When???""
JEFFREY
(pressing the key into Cole's hand)
Now!
VOICE/TV (o.s.)
Let us guide you to the stocks and
bonds that will enhance your portfolio.
JEFFREY
(leaping to his feet)
YES -- NOW! BUY NOW! STOCKS AND BONDS!
NO MORE MONKEY BUSINESS -- BUY NOW.
ANGLE ON TV, almost mimicking JEFFREY with an ad...a BULL and a
BEAR and a computer screen showing stock prices fluctuating.
VOICE/TV (v.o.)
A portfolio tailored to your specific
needs and the needs of your loved ones...
ANGLE ON COLE, dumbfounded, watching JEFFREY dance crazily.
JEFFREY
YES, YES. ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO NOW!
ANGLE ON BILLINGS, across the ward, reacting to JEFFREY, lets go
of the OLD MAN he's helping as another orderly, TERRY, presses a
beeper, calling for help.
ANGLE ON COLE, flabbergasted, as JEFFREY cavorts around the room.
JEFFREY
BUY! SELL! SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY!
ANGLE ON A HAND, inserting the last piece into the PEACEABLE
KINGDOM JIGSAW PUZZLE. Just then, JEFFREY'S HAND sweeps the
puzzle off the table, scattering it into a thousand pieces.
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, dancing away while the PATIENT who just
completed the puzzle stares, very upset.
Other PATIENTS are getting agitated, too, as JEFFREY avoids a
lunge by BILLINGS and dances off, using PATIENTS as a shield.
HEAVY WOMAN PATIENT
I'M GETTING DIZZY. MAKE HIM STOP!
SKINNY MAN PATIENT
HERE THEY COME! THEY'RE COMING!
OLD MAN PATIENT
FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS! I GOT FIVE
HUNDRED DOLLARS! I'M INSURED!
JEFFREY
OPPORTUNITY! DEFINITELY! A WINDOW OF
OPPORTUNITY! OPENING NOW! NOW'S THE TIME
FOR ALL GOOD MEN TO SEIZE THE MOMENT! YES!
YES! MASTERCARD! VISA! THE KEY TO HAPPINESS!
ANGLE ON COLE, realizing through the haze of drugs that JEFFREY
is sending a message to him. COLE looks at the ward door.
COLE'S POV: the WARD DOOR opens and two husky ORDERLIES enter.
One locks the door with a key, one of many on a key ring attached
to his belt, as the other ORDERLY rushes to join the pursuit.
JEFFREY
SEIZE THE MOMENT! GET RICH! NOW'S THE
TIME! GO FOR IT!
BILLINGS
(missing a tackle)
God damn you, Jeffrey, quit playing the fool.
ANGLE ON COLE, hesitating. He locks at the door...blurring in
and out of focus. He looks down at the key in his hand.
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, being grabbed by the ORDERLIES. JEFFREY
resists wildly as they struggle to overpower him.
JEFFREY
LAST CHANCE! LAST CHANCE! HEY -- OW!
ANGLE ON COLE, moving to the door. He reaches it and tries to
insert the key in the lock.
ANGLE ON LOCK, as the key keeps missing the hole.
ANGLE ON COLE, glancing nervously over his shoulder.
COLE'S POV: ORDERLIES swarm over JEFFREY, don't notice COLE.
ANGLE ON COLE, managing to insert the key. It won't turn.
A PATIENT, close at hand, startles COLE, speaking into his ear.
PATIENT
Place to go would be...Florida. The
keys are lovely this tine of year.
COLE, unnerved, desperate tries the key again. It turns.
PATIENT
Be careful. J. Edgar Hoover isn't really dead.
COLE pauses, stares, not understanding. Then, he opens the door.
INT. CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
Stepping through the door, COLE finds himself in an ante-room
facing several elevators.
A uniformed SECURITY MAN sitting at a near-by desk doesn't even
lock up from the magazine he's reading.
Barely daring to breathe, COLE steps toward the elevators so his
back is to the SECURITY MAN. But he doesn't know how to control
this elevator. What should he do?
SECURITY MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
Two's not working today. Use one.
COLE freezes, sneaks a glance over his shoulder.
COLE'S POV: the SECURITY MAN continues his reading. He's a big
guy with reading glasses perched on his nose. He looks exactly
like the MENACING GUARD IN THE FUTURE...SCARFACE!
ANGLE ON COLE, stunned!
Just then, an elevator door slides open. The elevator's empty.
COLE steps into it.
INT. ELEVATOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
The door closes, isolating COLE in the elevator.
COLE finds the down button, is about to push it when the elevator
springs to life. The numbers on the indicator over the door
start to rise. 7...8...9.
Then, the elevator stops and the door opens.
Two DOCTORS and an AIDE stand in front of the door, waiting.
COLE hesitates.
They look at him. They seem to expect him to exit.
Avoiding eye contact, COLE exits the elevator.
As they enter the elevator, the DOCTORS look back at COLE and frown.
INT. RAILLY'S OFFICE - MORNING
RAILLY has just arrived for work. She's slipping on her white
doctor's coat when...
DR. CASEY, one of the other residents, sticks his head in the
door waving a crayoned message on a page torn from a magazine.
DR. CASEY
This was in my box, but I have a slight
suspicion it wasn't meant for me.
CASEY enters the room, reading the scrawled words dramatically.
DR. CASEY
""You are the most beautiful woman I have
ever seen. You live in a beautiful
world. But you don't know it. You have
freedom, sunshine, air you can breathe.""
RAILLY
(smiling)
Cole. James Cole -- right?
She reaches for the note but CASEY moves it out of her grasp.
DR. CASEY
""I would do anything to stay here, but
I must leave. Please, help me.""
RAILLY
Poor man...
CASEY is handing her the note when another resident, DR. GOODINS,
sticks his head in the door. He's upset.
DR. GOODINS
Hey, Kathryn, James Cole is one of
yours, right?
RAILLY and CASEY stare at him.
DR. GOODINS
He got out. Took off. Last seen, he
was up on nine.
INT. X-RAY DEPARTMENT/BASEMENT - DAY
A PATIENT is being swallowed by a large tube, a CAT SCANNER,
while a DOCTOR in a white coat speaks reassuringly.
DOCTOR
Just relax -- don't fight it. We have
to know exactly what's there so we can...
The DOCTOR stops, astonished, as the door bursts open.
It's COLE! He stares at the PATIENT and the Cat Scanner.
The PATIENT lifts his head up and stares at COLE.
DOCTOR
Eh, excuse me. Can I help you?
COLE turns and rushes back out the door.
INT. CORRIDOR/COUNTY HOSPITAL
COLE steps into the corridor, turns to his right, freezes.
A POSSE of SECURITY GUARDS is headed in his direction.
COLE turns to his left.
Four ORDERLIES are coming that way.
COLE'S trapped. A beat. He attacks the nearest man. BILLINGS.
INT. TECH ROOM/PSYCH WARD - SHORTLY (DAY)
RAILLY prepares a hypo, turns to COLE who is strapped tightly on
a gurney with BILLINGS and an RN standing on either side, tense
for more trouble. One of BILLINGS' eyes is starting to swell shut.
RAILLY
It's just a shot to calm you.
COLE
No more drugs. Please...
RAILLY
I have to do this, James. You're very
confused.
RAILLY pushes the needle into COLE'S skin.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM/PSYCH WARD - LATER (DAY)
DR. FLETCHER faces RAILLY across the conference table. DR.
CASEY, DR. GOODINS, DR. MARILOU MARTIN are also there.
DR. FLETCHER
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't
an inquisition.
RAILLY
I didn't think I was being defensive.
I was just...
DR. FLETCHER
He should have been in restraints. It
was bad judgment on your part, plain
and simple. why not just cop to it?
RAILLY
Okay, it was bad judgment. But I have
the strangest feeling about him -- I've
seen him somewhere and...
DR. FLETCHER
(impatient, not interested)
Two policemen were already in the
hospital and now we have an orderly
with a broken arm and a Security
Officer with a fractured skull.
RAILLY
I said it was bad judgment! What else
do you want me to say?
DR. FLETCHER
You see what I mean? You're being defensive.
(to Dr. Casey)
Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
But just then, BILLINGS sticks his head in the door.
BILLINGS
Uh, Dr. Fletcher -- we got another...
situation.
INT. CORRIDOR/PSYCH WARD - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
DR. FLETCHER looks into an empty padded cell as RAILLY, MARTIN,
GOODIN, BILLINGS, PALMER and the NURSE crowd behind him.
DR. FLETCHER
He was in full restraints? And the
door was locked?
BILLINGS
Yes, sir. Did it myself.
DR. FLETCHER
And he was fully sedated?
RAILLY
He was fully sedated!
DR. FLETCHER
Then are you trying to tell me that a
fully sedated, fully restrained patient
somehow slipped out that vent, replaced
the grill behind him and that he's wriggling
through the ventilation system right now?
DR. FLETCHER indicates an impossibly tiny vent high in the wall.
INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
Seen through the glass windows, a 747 takes off, climbing into
the sky as the airport P.A. System drones...
P.A. SYSTEM
Flight 784 to San Francisco now
boarding at Gate 38...
YOUNG COLE, watching the 747, whirls at the SOUND of a COMMOTION.
MR. PONYTAIL bumps him.
The BLONDE MAN sprints past. The WOMAN'S VOICE calls out!
WOMAN'S VOICE
NOOOOOOOOOO!
TRAVELERS dive for cover briefly revealing the mysterious BRUNETTE
running after the BLONDE MAN! But this time, YOUNG COLE catches
just a glimpse of her face. She looks a little like RAILLY except
for the dark hair, the make-up. and the flashy earrings. She
calls out, her VOICE blending weirdly with the P.A. SYSTEM...
BRUNETTE/P. A. SYSTEM
The Freedom For Animals Headquarters
now boarding on Second Avenue. The
Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
ENGINEER'S VOICE (o.s.)
Cole, you moron -- wake up!
INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
As COLE blinks awake, the digitized monotone of the P.A. SYSTEM
continues to drone in an unearthly VOICE...
UNEARTHLY VOICE/P.A. SYSTEM
-- they're the ones who are going to do it...
COLE'S eyes seek the source of the sound and find it on the table
in front of the panel of disapproving SCIENTISTS facing him. It's
a beat-up old tape recorder.
UNEARTHLY VOICE/TAPE RECORDER
I can't do anything more. The Police
are after me.
The tape ends, runs off the reel, flap...flap...flap...
ASTROPHYSICIST
Well?
COLE
Uh, what?
ENGINEER
He's drugged out of his mind! He's
completely zoned out.
ASTROPHYSICIST
Cole, did you or did you not record
that message?
COLE
Uh, that message...me?
MICROBIOLOGIST
It's a digital reconstruction of a
message, Cole, from a weak signal on our
contact number. Did you make that call?
COLE
(angrily)
I couldn't call! You sent me to the
wrong year! It was 1989.
SCIENTISTS
1989!
The SCIENTISTS react, exchanging looks, whispers. Then,
ZOOLOGIST
You're certain of that?
GEOLOGIST
(before Cole can answer)
What did you do with your time, Cole?
Did you waste it on drugs? Women?
COLE
They forced me to take drugs.
BOTANIST
Forced you! Why would someone force
you to take drugs?
COLE
I got into trouble. I got arrested.
But I still got you a specimen -- a
spider -- but I didn't have anyplace to
put it, so I ate it. It was the wrong
year anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter.
The SCIENTISTS stare incredulously, then turn, exchange knowing
looks, huddle, start whispering to one another.
Struggling to stay awake COLE sees, blurrily, the MICROBIOLOGIST
staring at COLE intently. For one moment, the face belongs to
DR. FLETCHER!
COLE blinks hard...and the MICROBIOLOGIST has his own face, again.
COLE'S head slumps forward now...and everything goes dark.
GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (o.s.)
Cole!
INT. ENGINEERING OFFICE - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
COLE comes awake with a start. The room is dark now, except...
a slide is being projected on a torn screen. It's a picture of a
stenciled graffiti...the logo of The Army of the 12 Monkeys.
ENGINEER
What about it, Cole?
ZOOLOGIST
Did you see it?
COLE
Uh, no, sir. I...
Another slide CLICKS into place. Youthful PROTESTERS, their
placards featuring slogans and images of Animal Atrocities,
confront POLICE in riot gear.
ASTROPHYSICIST
What about these people? Did you see
any of these people?
Zooming in, panning, the SCIENTISTS emphasize the FACES of the
PROTESTERS. The FACES are unfamiliar to COLE (though WE will
recognize some of them later on).
COLE (o.s.)
Uh, no, sir, I...wait!
The image pans back to a much enlarged blurry FACE among the
PROTESTERS. In spite of the poor image, the expression of rage
is clear, and it seems to resemble a somewhat older JEFFREY MASON.
ASTROPHYSICIST
Him? You saw that man?
COLE
Uh, I think so. In the mental hospital.
MICRO3IOLOGIST
(switching on the light)
You were in a mental institution?!
The SCIENTISTS MUTTER disapprovingly among themselves.
ASTROPHYSICIST
You were sent to make very important
observations!
BOTANIST
You could have made a real contribution.
GEOLOGIST
Helped to reclaim the planet...
ZOOLOGIST
As well as reducing your sentence.
MICROBIOLOGIST
The question is, Cole -- ""Do you want
another chance?""
COLE stares at them, trying to figure out what they mean.
INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
The BRUNETTE runs up the concourse, her back to YOUNG COLE, as
frightened PASSENGERS duck for cover, SHOUTING!
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Hey! Who's that?
INT. CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT
COLE opens his eyes. Where is he? Silence as he examines the
tiny cell. Bare cement walls. High ceiling. Same color and
size as the isolation room at the county hospital.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Hey, Bob...what's your name?
COLE looks around frantically. Up, down. Where is the VOICE
coming from? Maybe from that tiny vent high in the wall...
COLE
Where are you?
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
You can talk! Wah'dja do, Bobby boy?
Volunteer?
COLE
My name's not ""Bob"".
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Not a prob, Bob. Where'd they send you?
COLE
Where are you?
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Another cell. ... Maybe.
COLE
What do you mean, ""maybe""? What's that
supposed to mean?
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Maybe. Means ""maybe"" I'm in the next cell,
another ""volunteer"" like you -- or ""maybe""
I'm in the Central Office spying on you
for all those science bozos. Or, hey, ""maybe""
I'm not even here. ""Maybe"" I'm just in
your head. No way to confirm anything.
Ha Ha. Where'd they send you?
COLE doesn't answer.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Not talking, huh, Bob? That's okay
I can handle that.
COLE
1989.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
89! How was it? Good drugs? Lotsa
pussy? Hey, Bob, you do the job? D'ju
find out the ""big info""?...Army of the
Twelve Monkeys...where the virus was
prior to mutation?
COLE
It was supposed to be 1995.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Science isn't an exact science with
these clowns. You're lucky you didn't
end up in ancient Egypt!
INT. LAB - ETERNAL NIGHT OF THE FUTURE
COLE is strapped on a gurney. SCIENTISTS hover near-by,
whispering. The walls of the gloomy chamber are damp, sweating.
GEOLOGIST
No mistakes this time, Cole.
ASTROPHYSICIST
Stay alert. Keep your eyes open.
ZOOLOGIST
Good thinking about that spider, Cole.
Try and do something like that again.
MICROBIOLOGIST
Just relax now -- don't fight it. We
have to know exactly what's there so we
can fix it.
The gurney is being wheeled into a crudely welded steel tube...
reminiscent of the cat scanner in County Hospital.
COLE'S POV: a last glimpse of anxious FACES, then the chamber
door is CLANGED shut.
EVERYTHING IS BLACK. A HUM BUILDS. THE BLACKNESS VIBRATES, THE
HUM REACHES A DEAFENING LEVEL, THEN DIMUENDOS. WE BEGIN TO HEAR
BURSTS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE, VOICES SHOUTING IN FRENCH, A SUDDEN
HUGE EXPLOSION! THEN...
EXT. TRENCH/FRANCE - DAY
DRIZZLING RAIN. And SCREAMS. COLE'S in a deep trench, naked,
eyes wide with terror. What's going on? Where is he? SOLDIERS
in gas masks push urgently past him rushing toward their injured
COMRADES who've been ripped apart by the shell that just hit
fifteen yards away. Muffled VOICES shout through gas masks...
in FRENCH. COLE doesn't know it, but this is World War I!
Suddenly, a SERGEANT confronts him, shouting in French.
SERGEANT
(FRENCH, subtitled)
Where's your mask?! And your clothes...
and your weapon, you idiot?!
COLE
What? What??
COLE looks around desperately. A horribly WOUNDED MAN is being
stretchered past them in the narrow trench. Machine guns chatter
close at hand. AAK AAK AAK. A grenade EXPLODES. Reacting to the
foreign word, the SERGEANT jams his bayonet into COLE'S ribs...
SERGEANT
(FRENCH, subtitled)
Captain! A Kraut! We got a Kraut!
COLE
I don't understand. Where am I?
The CAPTAIN hurries over, snapping at COLE in German.
CAPTAIN
(GERMAN, subtitled)
How'd you get here, soldier? What's
your rank? Where are your clothes?
COLE
I...don't understand.
CAPTAIN
(frowning, GERMAN, subtitled)
German! Speak German! What are you
doing here?
VOICE (o.s.)
(pleading in English)
I gotta find 'em. I gotta find 'em.
Please, you gotta help me!
COLE turns, sees...
It's his friend, JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid from the next cell in
the ""underground"" time. He's being carried past COLE now on a
stretcher, blood all over his torso, horribly wounded.
COLE
JOSE!
JOSE
Cole! Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
JOSE reaches out to COLE just as a PHOTOGRAPHER takes a FLASH
PICTURE of the kid being carried off on the stretcher. SUDDENLY,
SHOTS RING OUT. COLE goes down. Hit in the leg!
SOLDIERS in gas masks rush past him like giant insects.
Looking to his left, COLE sees the CAPTAIN lying beside him, dead
from a chest wound, his gas mask half off.
COLE is reaching for the mask when...
A SHELL HITS CLOSE BY WITH AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION.
EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT
Stunningly quiet. We are on a placid campus looking at the
dignified architecture of Breitrose Hall. MOVING IN we FOCUS ON
a large poster advertising ""The Alexander Lectures, Spring 1995"".
WE SKIM the listings (Jon Else on The Nuclear Agony, Dr. Andrew
Miksztal on Biological Ethics, etc.) until we SETTLE ON...
DR. KATHRYN RAILLY
MADNESS AND APOCALYPTIC VISIONS
MAY 17
INT. AUDITORIUM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
A large screen dominates the auditorium stage. On the screen is
a slide of an engraving from the Middle Ages showing a MADMAN in
apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained
by PEASANTS. The projector ZOOMS slowly in on the agonized FACE
of this MADMAN as we HEAR RAILLY'S VOICE lecturing.
RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
According to the accounts of local
officials at that time, this gentleman,
judged to be about forty years of age,
appeared suddenly in the village of Wyle
near Stonehenge in the West of England in
April of 1162. Using unfamiliar words and
speaking in a strange accent, the man made
dire prognostications about a pestilence
which he predicted would wipe out humanity
in approximately 8OO years. Deranged and
hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the
village, was taken into custody, but then
mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.
WE DISCOVER RAILLY, six years older now, standing at a lectern
in a pool of light. She's dwarfed by the giant screen where the
engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing
scenes of pestilence in the Middle Ages as she lectures to an
audience of mostly SCHOLARLY TYPES.
RAILLY (cont.)
In 1841, Mackay wrote, ""During seasons
of great pestilence, men have often
believed the prophecies of crazed
fanatics, that the end of the world was
come."" Obviously, this plague/doomsday
scenario is considerably more compelling
when reality supports it in some form,
whether it's the Bubonic Plague, smallpox,
or AIDS. In addition to these ""natural""
contagions, there are now technological
horrors as well: besides radiation,
consider our lurking fear of germ
warfare and its close approximation,
chemical warfare, which first reared
its ugly head in the deadly mustard
gas attacks during the First World War.
ON THE SCREEN, a SERIES of SLIDES show images of WORLD WAR I
SOLDIERS in gas masks, in death throes, etc..
RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
During such an attack in the French
trenches in October, 1917, we have an
account of this soldier...
ON THE SCREEN, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows
JOSE, the Puerto Rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried
by SOLDIERS through the trenches during an attack. JOSE appears
to be ranting madly as the projector ZOOMS CLOSER on his face until
the image approximates Munch's famous painting.
RAILLY'S VOICE (cant. o.s.)
-- who, during an assault, was wounded
by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the
lines where Doctors discovered he had
lost all comprehension of French but
spoke English fluently, albeit in a
regional dialect they didn't recognize.
The man, although physically unaffected
by the gas, was hysterical. He claimed
he had come from the future, that he was
looking for a pure germ that would
ultimately wipe mankind off the face of
the earth in the year... 1995!
The AUDIENCE gives a nervous CHUCKLE.
ON THE SCREEN, a different old photograph of JOSE. This time
he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.
RAILLY'S VOICE (cont. o.s.)
Although seriously injured, the young
soldier disappeared from the hospital
before more data could be gathered. No
doubt, he was trying to carry on his
mission to warn others, substituting
for the agony of war...a self-inflicted
agony we call the ""Cassandra Complex"".
As RAILLY continues, we SCAN the AUDIENCE and DISCOVER MARILOU MARTIN,
RAILLY'S friend, and MARILOU'S HUSBAND, WAYNE CHANG, both listening
attentively. Further away, another MAN listens intently. A MAN with
shoulder-length carrot-colored hair. His name is DR. PETERS.
RAILLY (cont.)
Cassandra, in Greek legend you will recall,
was condemned to know the future but to be
disbelieved when she foretold it. Hence,
the agony of foreknowledge combined with
impotence to do anything about it.
INT. RECEPTION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER (NIGHT)
A stack of new books. THE DOOMSDAY SYNDROME, Apocalyptic
Visions of the Mentally Ill by Dr. Kathryn Railly
Surrounded by enthusiastic members of the audience, RAILLY is
seated at the table signing books but DR. PETERS has her ear.
DR. PETERS
I think, Dr. Railly, you have given
your alarmists a bad name. Surely
there is very real and very convincing
data that the planet cannot survive the
excesses of the human race: proliferation
of atomic devices, uncontrolled breeding
habits, the rape of the environment, the
pollution of land, sea, and air. In this
context, isn't it obvious that ""Chicken
Little"" represents the sane vision and
that Homo Sapiens' motto, ""Let's go
shopping!"" is the cry of the true lunatic?
DR. PETERS smiles self-importantly at RAILLY as an elderly
disheveled PROFESSOR elbows in front of him.
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
Doctor Railly -- please! I wonder if
you're aware of my own studies which
indicate that certain cycles of the
moon actually impact on the incidence
of apocalyptic predictions as observed
in urban emergency rooms and...
As the PROFESSOR babbles, MARILOU MARTIN and her husband, WAYNE
CHANG, appear and whisper...
MARILOU
You were great.
RAILLY
You're leaving?
MARILOU
The reservation's at nine thirty --
it's getting late.
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
Doctor Railly -- please -- this is very
important!
WAYNE CHANG
(checking the professor)
You sure you're gonna be all right?
RAILLY
(smiles, checks her watch)
I'll be there in twenty minutes.
DISHEVELED PROFESSOR
Dr. Railly, I simply cannot understand
your exclusion of the moon in relation
to apocalyptic dementia...
EXT. PARKING LOT/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
A full moon.
COLLEAGUES in a VOLVO pull out of the parking lot, calling,
""Congratulations"" to RAILLY.
She waves back as she hurries to her black ACURA, one of the last
cars left in the lot.
The outside lights of Breitrose Hall go off.
RAILLY seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her
purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when...
Suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke-hold by a large
shadowy MAN looming out of the darkness behind her.
MAN'S VOICE
Get in!
Unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the
front seat.
MAN'S VOICE
I've got a gun.
RAILLY freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and
scrambles in behind her.
INT. ACURA/PARKING LOT
Fighting to suppress the quaver in her voice, RAILLY says...
RAILLY
You can have my purse. I have a lot of
cash and credit...
MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
Start the car.
Glancing in the rear view mirror, RAILLY sees penetrating eyes
peering out of the shadows, no other features.
Half-turning in the seat, she holds out the keys to him.
RAILLY
Here! You can have the keys. You can...
He grabs her hair and yanks her head back hard, speaking fiercely
into her ear, his face last in shadow.
MAN
START THE CAR! NOW!
EXT. ACURA/PARKING LOT
The engine STARTS, the Acura backs up, then heads for the exit.
INT. ACURA
Steering fearfully, RAILLY hears him speak more calmly now.
MAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
I don't want to hurt you. But I will.
I've hurt people before when...when I
had no choice. Turn left.
As she makes the turn, RAILLY glances in the rear view mirror,
sees him unfolding a tattered map. His face is lost in darkness
but she glimpses ragged, torn clothing as he tries to read the
map by the intermittent glow of passing street lights.
RAILLY
Where... where are we going'
MAN
I need you to drive me to Philadelphia.
RAILLY
(startled, horrified)
But that's... that's more than 200 miles!
MAN
That's why I can't walk there. Turn
here... I think...
RAILLY obeys. She glances in the mirror again, hesitates, then
boldly switches on the dome light, holding her breath fearfully
for his reaction.
He grunts appreciatively. Relieved, she looks in the mirror
again, trying to get a better look at him, but now his features
are concealed by the map.
RAILLY
If you make me go with you, it's
kidnapping. That's a serious crime.
If you let me go, you could just take
the car and...
MAN
I don't know how to drive! We went
underground when I was nine, I told you
that. When you come to the corner,
turn right.
Startled, RAILLY whirls, looks right at him.
He's lowered the map. It's COLE! Haggard, unshaven, dirty.
RAILLY
Cole! James Cole! You escaped from a
locked room six years ago.
COLE
1989. Six years for you. There's the
sign! Right here!
COLE is indicating a freeway entrance.
RAILLY turns the wheel sharply.
EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
The Acura veers up the ramp and onto the freeway.
INT. ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT
RAILLY glances in the mirror, sees COLE settling back wearily
against the seat. She says carefully...
RAILLY
I can't believe this is a coincidence,
Mr. Cole. Have you been...following me?
COLE
You told me you'd help me. I know this
isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate...
no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets.
I probably smell bad. Sorry about that.
But then I saw your book in a store window
with a notice about your lecture.
(sudden pride)
I can read, remember?
RAILLY
Yes, I remember.
(a beat, then)
Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
COLE
It's the next step. I checked out the
Baltimore information, it was nothing.
It's Philadelphia, that's where they
are, the ones who killed everyone.
(pointing suddenly, eagerly)
Zs that a radio? Does it play music?
RAILLY turns on the radio and immediately WE HEAR the SOUND of SURF
and the CRIES of gulls, background to an oozing baritone COMMERCIAL.
COMMERCIAL/RADIO (o.s.)
This is a personal message to you.
COLE sits up, alert, listening intently.
COMMERCIAL/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
Are you at the end of your rope? Are
you dying to get away?
COLE'S eyes narrow, concentrating on this personal message.
COMMERCAIL/RADIO (cont. o.s.}
The Florida Keys are waiting for you.
COLE frowns as the SOUND of breaking SURF and crying GULLS fills
the car. It's confusing! He blurts out...
COLE
I've never seen the ocean!
Observing his confusion in the mirror, RAILLY assumes her
professional tone.
RAILLY
It's an advertisement, Mr. Cole. You
do understand that, don't you? It's
not really a special message to you.
COLE frowns. He did think it was for him, but she's probably right.
COLE
You used to call me ""James"".
RAILLY
You'd prefer that? ... James...you
don't really have a gun, do you.
COLE
(cynical laugh)
Everybody's got a gun. In this city...
He breaks off reacting to the RADIO MUSIC! FATS DOMINO singing
""BLUEBERRY HILL""! COLE grins, mouth agape, eyes wide like a kid's.
COLE
Can you...can you make it louder? I
love hearing twentieth century music!
Hearing music and breathing air!
As RAILLY cranks up the volume, she watches the mirror
incredulously, sees him stick his head out the window into the
wind, mouth open, ""eating"" the air hungrily.
EXT. FREEWAY/ACURA - NIGHT
""BLUEBERRY HILL"" BLARES as the Acura, COLE'S head out the rear
window, zips past a sign at 65 mph.
The sign says, ""PHILADELPHIA 233 MILES.""
INT. ACURA/FREEWAY - NIGHT
RAILLY glances in the mirror at the nut in the rear seat with his
head out the window. what can she do? Just then, while she's
trying to figure something out, an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE breaks in...
ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
This just in from Fresno, California:
emergency crews are converging on a
cornfield where playmates of nine year
old Ricky Neuman say they saw him
disappear right before their eyes.
COLE pulls his head back inside with a frown, troubled now.
ANNOUNCER/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
Young Neuman apparently stepped into an
abandoned well shaft and is lodged somewhere
in the narrow 150 foot pipe, possibly alive,
possibly seriously injured. Playmates claim
they heard him cry out faintly but since then
there has been no contact with...
COLE
""Never cry wolf!""
RAILLY
What?
COLE
My father told me that. ""Never cry
wolf."" Then people won't believe you
if...something really happens.
RAILLY
""If something really happens""...like
what, James?
COLE
Something bad. Is that all the music?
I don't want to hear this stuff...
RAILLY glances at him as she scans stations.
RAILLY
Did something terrible happen to you when
you were a child? Something so bad...?
COLE
Ohhhh, that one! Can we hear that one?
It's IVORY JOE HUNTER singing, ""SINCE I MET YOU, BABY"".
IVORY JOE/RADIO (o.s.)
""Since I met you, baby,
My whole life has changed...
Ecstatic, COLE sticks his head out the window again.
EXT. ACURA/FREEWAY
COLE'S POV: the heavens, glittering with a million stars and a
lover's moon as IVORY JOE croons the achingly romantic lyrics...
IVORY JOE/RADIO (cont. o.s.)
""-- cause since I met you, baby.
All I need is you...""
ANGLE ON COLE, wind in his hair, eyes shining, gulping air blissfully.
INT. RAILLY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
Two POLICE OFFICERS and an anxious MARILOU MARTIN listen to an
answering machine's message while a hungry CAT cries plaintively.
ANSWERING MACHINE
Dr. Railly -- this is Palmer from Psych
Admitting. There was a guy here this
afternoon looking for you. He seemed
very agitated. We tried to keep him, but
he refused 'n I kept thinking, I know
this guy. Then, just a few minutes ago,
it came to me. It's Cole! James Cole.
Remember him? The paranoid who pulled
the Houdini back in '89. Well, he's
back and he's...cuckoo...and he's looking
for you. I thought you oughta know.
The machine switches off. The POLICE OFFICERS exchange a look.
MARILOU MARTIN
It's just as I told you -- my husband
and I had gone ahead -- she never
showed. That's totally unlike her!
OFFICER TWO
(pulls out his notebook)
Do you happen to know the make of her car?
MARILOU MARTIN
Um...Acura...'92 Acura. ... Also, that
cat's starving! She would never neglect
her cat!
EXT. MOTEL - MORNING
The ACURA is parked outside room 46 of the HIGHWAYS & BYWAYS
MOTEL, which has definitely seen better days.
INT. MOTEL ROOM 46
The TV is on. A commercial is just starting. A catfood jingle.
The sound of HEAVY BREATHING.
ANGLE ON COLE, sweating, BREATHING HEAVILY, sprawled on one side
of the double bed, sound asleep.
INT. CONCOURSE/AIRPORT - DAY (THE DREAM)
GUNSHOT! YOUNG COLE glimpses the BLONDE MAN staggering, wounded.
The mysterious BRUNETTE races past him toward the BLONDE MAN, and
YOUNG COLE again glimpses the resemblance to RAILLY, in spite of
the dark hair, the make-up, the flashy earrings.
Close at hand, YOUNG COLE'S FATHER, his face still out of view, says,
FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
Son, it's important for your cat to
have the nourishment necessary for
healthy bones and a rich coat.
INT. MOTEL ROOM 46
COLE comes awake with a start. He stares, disoriented, at the
CATFOOD COMMERCIAL on the TV.
RAILLY'S VOICE (o.s.)
Please untie me. I'm very uncomfortable.
COLE turns to RAILLY, beside him on the bed, frightened and
helpless, her jacket arranged to restrain her like a strait-jacket.
COLE'S instinct is to free her at once, but he controls his
impulse. He looks away, gets up, and, wincing, limps to the
dresser, stepping around empty fast-food cartons. He pulls a
razor and shaving soap from a paper bag, then goes into the
bathroom, leaving the door open, and starts to shave.
COLE
You were in my dream just now. Your hair
was different, but I'm sure it was you.
RAILLY
We dream about what's important in our lives.
And I seem to have become pretty important
in yours. What was the dream about?
COLE
About an airport...before everything
happened. It's the same dream I always
have -- the only one. I'm a little kid
in it.
RAILLY
And I was in it? What did I do?
COLE
You were very upset. You're always
very upset in the dream, but I never
knew it was you before.
RAILLY
It wasn't me before, James. It's
become me now because of...what's
happening. Please untie me.
Finished shaving, COLE re-enters the bedroom, toweling his face.
COLE
No, I think it was always you. It's
very strange.
RAILLY
You're flushed. And you were moaning.
I think you're running a fever. What
are you doing?
COLE is rummaging through RAILLY'S wallet, pulling out money.
COLE
I'll be back in a minute.
He heads for the door.
RAILLY
No! Don't leave me here like this!
Too late! He shuts the door behind him, leaving her alone.
ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, where an ANCHORMAN sits at a News Set.
TV ANCHORMAN
And in Fresno, California...crews
continue to attempt to rescue nine year
old Ricky Neuman.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, twisting and struggling on the bed, trying to
get loose, tears welling in her eyes.
TV ANCHORMAN (cont. o.s.)
The boy was playing ball with four
other children when he literally
disappeared off the face of the earth.
EXT. MOTEL CORRIDOR - MORNING
COLE puzzles over a junk food vending machine, inserts coins tentatively.
INT. MOTEL ROOM
ANGLE ON TV, the picture of RAILLY filling the screen.
----------------------- PAGE 52 MISSING -----------------------
COLE
My notes. Observations. Clues.
RAILLY
Clues? What kind of clues?
COLE
A secret army. The Army of The Twelve
Monkeys. I've told you about them.
They spread the virus. That's why we
have to get to Philadelphia. I have to
find them -- it's my assignment.
RAILLY
What will you do...when you find
this...secret army?
COLE
I just have to locate the virus in its
original form before it mutates. So
scientists can come back and study it
and find a cure. So that those of us
who survived can go back to the surface
of the earth.
RAILLY maintains a professional deadpan, says nothing as they pass
a pickup truck with a MOTHER, FATHER, and five KIDS in the back.
COLE stares at the KIDS, a sad look in his eyes.
COLE
You won't think I'm crazy next month.
People are going to start dying. At
first the papers will say it's some
weird fever, some virus. Then they'll
begin to catch on. They'll get it.
RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
We interrupt this program with a
special bulletin...
RAILLY and COLE both react to the radio, suddenly alert.
RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
This report just in from Fresno,
California. Naval sonar specialists
who were flown to the site...
COLE
I thought it was about us. I thought
maybe they'd found us and arrested me
or something.
RAILLY stares at COLE.
COLE
Just a joke.
RADIO NEWSCASTER (o.s.)
-- an hour ago have been unable to
determine the location of the boy in the
150 foot shaft...but a TV sound man who
lowered an ultra-sensitive microphone into
the narrow tube claims he heard breathing
sounds coming from approximately seventy
feet down...
COLE reaches over and changes stations. MUSIC again.
RAILLY
Does that disturb you, James? Thinking
about that little boy in the well?
COLE
When I was a kid I identified with that
kid, down there alone in that pipe...a
hundred feet down -- doesn't know if
they're going to save him.
RAILLY
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
COLE
Nevermind. It's not real -- it's a
hoax. A prank. He's hiding in a barn.
Hey, turn left here. Left!
COLE quickly checks the map as RAILLY stares, then turns left.
EXT. SKID ROW STREET/PHILADELPHIA - DAY
An elderly EVANGELIST with long stringy hair, wearing a tattered
bathrobe, stands on a Skid Row corner WAVING a worn Bible as he
rants at disinterested DERELICTS, WINOS, and BAG LADIES.
EVANGELIST
""And the wild beasts of the islands
shall cry in their desolate houses and
dragons in their pleasant palaces: and
her time is near to come, and her days
shall not be prolonged.""
ANGLE ON RAILLY'S ACURA, crawling down the street, RAILLY driving,
COLE, beside her, staring out the window.
INT. ACURA/SKID ROW STREET
COLE is scrutinizing the crumbling walls, boarded-up store
fronts, tattered posters, decaying signs, miserable ""RESIDENTS"".
COLE
Where I come from we think of this as Eden.
If we could just see the sun, eat sun-grown
food. Eden! Look at them! They donut
know what they have. They don't see the
sky. They don't feel the air!
COLE'S POV: a BMW speeds toward them, passes, its radio BLARING!
COLE (o.s.)
And the ones who aren't hungry are so smug
they haven't a clue. WAIT! STOP!
EXT. ACURA/SKID ROW
On foot now, COLE pulls an astonished RAILLY to a wall covered with
graffiti, a hopeless tangle of symbols, words, and crude pictures.
Clueless, RAILLY stares at the wall, then at COLE.
COLE touches a bit of red-stenciled graffiti hidden under gang
insignias. We can just see TWELVE MONKEYS holding hands in a circle.
COLE
The Twelve Monkeys!!! They're here.
(looks around)
Somewhere. Come on!
He pulls her along the sidewalk. No question, he's insane.
At the next alley entrance, COLE stops abruptly. Then, still
keeping a firm grip on RAILLY'S arm, he starts ripping down newly
tacked-up posters announcing a Rap concert.
RAILLY stares at him, then turns and is looking all around when,
suddenly, COLE pulls her up tight and threatens...
COLE
Look, I'm warning you. You do anything,
I'm going to go crazy -- hurt people!
RAILLY
I'm not going to ""do"" anything, I
promise. But you need help, James.
None of this is what you think it is.
ANGLE ON COLE, not listening, staring triumphantly! He's found
another partially obscured stencil of THE TWELVE MONKEYS!
But just then, a raspy VOICE startles COLE.
RASPY VOICE (o.s)
You can't hide from them, Bob.
COLE whirls, sees a derelict, LOUIE, leering at him, speaking in a
voice eerily like the RASPY VOICE from the next cell in the future.
LOUIE
No, sir, Old Bob -- don't even try.
(conspiratorially)
They hear everything. They got that
tracking device on you. They can find
you anywhere. Anytime. Ha Ha!
RAILLY looks from LOUIS to COLE, sees COLE'S stunned reaction.
LOUIE
(touches his back jaw)
In the tooth, Bob! Right?
(sudden triumphant grin)
But I fooled 'em, old buddy!
He opens his mouth wide. NO TEETH'
COLE grabs RAILLY and pulls her into the alley and down it.
COLE
They're keeping an eye on me.
RAILLY
Who's keeping an eye on you?
COLE
The man...with the voice. I recognized
him. He's from the present. He...
COLE breaks off, freezes as he sees...
there on a brick wall is a stencil of the DANCING MONKEYS
And further on, another red stencil!
EXT. VACANT LOT - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
CRACKHEADS huddle against a building, sucking their pipes,
oblivious to COLE pulling RAILLY past.
COLE scans the walls for messages in the confusion of graffiti.
RAILLY is considering her surroundings dubiously when, suddenly,
COLE pulls her toward the mouth of a dark and forbidding alley.
RAILLY
James, no -- we shouldn't be here!
COLE ignores her, yanking her after him into the alley.
INT. DARK ALLEY - DAY
Two TOM CATS face off, arching their backs and HISSING menacingly.
COLE avoids them as he pulls RAILLY into the gloom.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, seeing something alarming twenty yards ahead!
RAILLY'S POV: TWO THUGS, standing over a MAN, kicking him.
RAILLY tries to stop, but COLE, intent on the wall messages,
doesn't notice the THUGS.
The TWO THUGS turn and spot COLE and RAILLY moving toward them.
These creeps have mean eyes, predator faces.
RAILLY digs her heels in, forcing COLE to stop.
RAILLY
James! We have to go back. Those men...
Too late. While COLE turns and stares at her, uncomprehending,
the TWO THUGS are approaching.
FIRST THUG
Hey, buddy.
Startled, COLE turns to face them.
The SECOND THUG lunges for RAILLY'S purse, yanks it from her.
COLE reaches to grab it back, but...WHACK! The FIRST THUG smacks
COLE hard across the face with something metallic.
Bloody-faced, dazed, COLE doesn't even have a chance to clear his
head as the FIRST THUG shoves the hard object against COLE'S
cheek. It's a cheap thirty-eight pistol.
RAILLY turns to run, gets two steps before the SECOND THUG knocks
her roughly to the ground.
SECOND THUG
Stick around, bitch.
Looming over her, the SECOND THUG starts to unzip his fly.
RAILLY looks over to COLE, SEES...
COLE dropping to his knees, groveling at the FIRST THUG'S feet.
COLE
Please! Please don't hurt me!
The FIRST THUG steps close, kicks COLE contemptuously, cocks his
foot for a second kick when...
COLE uncoils, lunging, rising, his strong arms around the bigger
man's calves, lifting him mightily, high off the ground.
The gun FIRES wildly as COLE staggers forward with the FIRST THUG
in his arms and smashes the man into the brick wail behind him.
The FIRST THUG goes down in a heap, dropping the pistol.
Zipping his fly hastily, the SECOND THUG turns to deal with COLE
but COLE attacks him....rocking him again and again with savage
blows that come one after another with lightning speed. The SECOND
THUG staggers back, bloody and dazed as RAILLY watches, amazed.
Turning back to the FIRST THUG, COLE sees the MAN reaching for
the dropped pistol.
COLE kicks him viciously in the jaw. The FIRST THUG'S head whips
back. SNAP! He collapses against the brick wall.
COLE turns back to see the SECOND THUG retreating down the alley
as fast as he can stagger.
RAILLY stares up at COLE. He looks very dangerous. He glances
in her direction as he pockets the pistol.
COLE
Are you hurt?
RAILLY
Uh, no. Yes. I mean, just some scrapes...
As RAILLY gets to her feet, she sees COLE bend over the
motionless THUG and quickly go through his pockets.
RAILLY
Is he...alive?
COLE ignores the question as he pockets the man's wallet and a
handful of bullets, then turns and snaps at RAILLY.
COLE
Come an. We're running out of time.
You can't help him.
As COLE yanks her roughly away, she looks back, sees the FIRST
THUG'S sightless eyes, wide open...staring blankly.
RAILLY
Oh, Jesus, James! You killed him!
COLE
I did him a favor. Now come on.
COLE, pulling her again, sees more ""12 MONKEYS"" on the wall.
RAILLY
You didn't have a gun before, did you?
COLE
I've got one now.
EXT. SECOND AVE - DAY
The EVANGELIST, spotting COLE and RAILLY hurrying past him,
points urgently at COLE.
EVANGELIST
You! You! You're one of us, aren't you?
But COLE has stopped and is staring at...
A STOREFRONT OFFICE...its windows covered with posters. The sign
over the office says, FREEDOM FOR ANIMALS ASSOCIATION.
INT. FAA STORE - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)
Earnest young activists, FALE, deathly pale, BEN, long haired,
and TEDDY, muscular, are gathered around a counter collating
leaflets that demand an END TO SPECIEISM. Behind them, a large
poster proclaims, ""ANIMALS HAVE SOULS, TOO"". Just then, there's
a tremendous CLAP OF THUNDER as the ACTIVISTS look up and see
COLE and RAILLY enter.
COLE looks startled. It sounds like torrential RAIN POURING in
here. Maintaining a tight grip on RAILLY'S wrist, he looks
around frantically for an explanation for the tropical downpour.
Bookshelves line two walls. The front window is blanked cut with
posters of Animal Rights demonstrations, newspaper clippings,
photos of animal atrocities. The fourth wall features the
counter where the three ACTIVISTS face COLE as a JUNGLE BIRD
SCREAMS in the DOWNPOUR.
FALE
Uh, can we help you?
COLE looks confused as the RAIN abates and an ELEPHANT trumpets
an urgent warning.
FALE
Excuse me. You looking for something
in particular?
RAILLY
It's all right, James -- it's just a tape.
COLE'S eyes follow her look. It's a tape recorder underneath a
sign advertising, ""THE TRUE MUSIC OF THE WORLD"".
COLE
I, uh, I'm looking for the, ah, the
Army of the Twelve Monkeys.
FALE glances at BEN and TEDDY. ""We have a problem!"" the look says.
MONKEYS start CHATTERING on the tape as TEDDY comes around the
counter, bigger than COLE, physically imposing, menacing.
TEDDY
We don't know anything about any ""Army
of the Twelve Monkeys"", so why don't
you and your friend disappear, okay?
COLE backs away, a firm grip on RAILLY, as a LION ROARS.
COLE
I just need some information...
TEDDY
Didn't you hear me? We're not...
TEDDY breaks off mid-sentence...freezes.
COLE is pointing a pistol at them. A TIGER SNARLS.
RAILLY
James, no -- don't hurt them.
(to the activists)
Please, I'm a psychiatrist -- just do
whatever he tells you to do. He's...
upset -- disturbed. Please -- he's
dangerous -- just cooperate.
MONKEYS CHATTER wildly as TEDDY backs up.
FALE
What do you want -- money? We only
have a few bucks.
COLE is suddenly very much in charge and self-confident again. A
BABOON HOWLS with laughter.
COLE
I told you what I want.
(snaps at Railly)
Lock the door!
RAILLY
James, why don't we...?
COLE
Lock it now!
RAILLY hurries to the door to lock it as BEN says to FALE,
BEN
I told you that fuckhead Mason would
get us into something like this.
FALE
Shut up!
COLE
Mason???
RAILLY
Jeffrey Mason?
BEN
Yeah, tucking, crazy Jeffrey Mason.
INT. FAA STORE BASEMENT - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)
The three ACTIVISTS are tied tightly together in the middle of
the floor in this dimly-lit, windowless basement. They're very
frightened, eager to cooperate.
FALE
Then, Jeffrey becomes like this...big
star -- the media latch on to him
because he's picketing his own father,
a ""famous Nobel Prize winning virologist"".
You musta seen all that on TV.
COLE
No, I don't watch TV.
COLE, the gun next to him, rummages through boxes of papers while
RAILLY watches helplessly. Suddenly, COLE finds something he
thinks he's seen before. He holds it up.
COLE
Is this him -- Dr. Mason?
It's a photograph of DR. MALCOLM MASON, being escorted by a
phalanx of riot cops through a mob of raging activists.
FALE
That's him.
BEN
(very frightened)
What are you going to do with us?
COLE
(stares at the photo, then)
Tell me more about Jeffrey.
FALE
(a helpless shrug to his cohorts)
Jeffrey started getting bored with the
shit we do...picketing, leafleting,
letter-writing stuff. He said we were,
""ineffectual liberal jerkoffs"". He
wanted to do guerrilla ""actions"" to
""educate"" the public.
COLE holds up a clipping showing horrified SENATORS standing on
their desks as RATTLESNAKES slither along the Senate Floor.
FALE
Yeah, that's when he let a hundred
snakes loose in the Senate.
TEDDY
But we weren't into that kind of stuff.
It's counter productive, we told him.
FALE
So he and eleven others split off and
became this underground...""army""
COLE
The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.
BEN
They started planning a ""Human Hunt"".
TEDDY
They bought stun guns and nets and bear
traps. They were gonna go to Wall
Street and trap lawyers and bankers...
BEN
But they didn't do it. They didn't do
any of it.
TEDDY
Yeah, just like always, Mr. Big Shot
sold his friends out!
COLE
What's that mean?
FALE
He goes on TV, gives a news conference,
tells the whole world he just realized
his daddy's experiments are vital for
humanity and that the use of animals is
absolutely necessary and that he, Jeffrey
Mason, from now on, is going to personally
supervise the labs to make sure all the
little animals aren't going to suffer.
COLE
(holding up a rolodex)
What's this?
EXT. FREEWAY - AFTERNOON
In the crawling traffic, WE FIND a battered FORD covered with
bumper stickers and painted slogans. ""I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS""...
""FREE THE ANIMALS""...""WOULD YOU LET A MINK WEAR YOUR SKIN?""
RAILLY (v.o.)
You can't just barge in on a famous
scientist. They'll have security guards,
gates, alarm systems. It's insane, James.
INT. MOVING FORD/FREEWAY
A ROLODEX CARD with an address on ""Outerbridge Road"" for ""Jeffrey
Mason c/o Dr. Malcolm Mason"" rests on a map spread across COLE'S
lap. COLE is in the passenger seat, RAILLY'S at the wheel,
maneuvering in heavy traffic.
RAILLY
If those young men don't get loose,
they could die in that basement.
COLE glances out the window, indicates the PEOPLE in passing
cars...COMMUTERS, FAMILIES, TRUCKERS.
COLE
All I see are dead people. Everywhere.
What's three more?
RAILLY
(a beat, carefully, a new tack)
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey
Mason, don't you, James? You met him
in the County Hospital six years ago.
COLE is studying the map again.
COLE
The guy was a total fruitcake.
RAILLY
And he told you then his father was a
famous virologist.
COLE is absorbed in the map, his finger tracing ""Outerbridge Road"".
COLE
No -- he said his father was ""God""!
EXT./INT. FORD/COUNTRY HIGHWAY - LATER (DAY)
The RADIO BLARES a country song as the Ford zips along an open
highway. COLE has his head out the window, sucking air, loving
the music, but his bliss is feverish now -- he's not well. As
the SONG ends, he pulls his head inside. An ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
intones over the RADIO...
RADIO ANNOUNCER (o.s.)
This just in: police are widening
their search for Dr. Kathryn Railly,
prominent psychiatrist and author.
Authorities confirm that Dr. Railly has
been abducted by escaped mental patient,
James Cole. The two are believed to be
traveling in Railly's 1992 black Acura,
license plate H-E-A-D-D-R.
RAILLY glances at him, sees he's in pain. She feels so badly for
him. She wants to help him. She says, tenderly...
RAILLY
This can't go on, James. You're not
well. You're burning with fever.
COLE, refusing to succumb, instead, leans over to check the gas gauge.
COLE
We need gas.
RAILLY
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
COLE
I said I was too young to drive. I
didn't say I was stupid.
RAILLY
What's the matter with your leg?
COLE
I got shot. Look -- there's a gas
station up ahead.
RAILLY
Shot! Who shot you?
COLE
It was some kind of...war. Never mind,
you wouldn't believe me. Turn off here.
INT. PARKED FORD/GAS STATION - MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON)
The GAS STATION ATTENDANT checks the oil while COLE and RAILLY
remain in the car. She's pulling a gas card from her wallet.
COLE
You were going to run out off gas on
purpose, weren't you?
RAILLY
No. I want you to turn yourself in, James --
It'll go much better for you if you do
-- but I'm not going to trick you.
COLE
(sees the credit card)
That has your name on it. Give him cash.
RAILLY puts the card back into her wallet and pulls out cash as
the GAS STATION ATTENDANT slams the hood down.
RAILLY starts opening the door. Alarmed, COLE tries to stop her.
COLE
Where are you going?
She looks him in the eye, then indicates the tiny Convenience
Store appended to the Gas Station.
RAILLY
You can come with me. I have to get
some things. Scissors, bandages, some
alcohol or whiskey. ... I have to look
at your leg, James. I'm a doctor.
COLE looks helpless, hesitant. She's in charge...for the moment.
EXT. CLEARING/WOODS - AN HOUR LATER (AFTERNOON)
The sun dazzles through the canopy of leaves. We HEAR the CAR
RADIO but not the engine.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (v.o.)
Meanwhile in Fresno, where mining
engineers continue their desperate
attempt to sink a shaft parallel to the
ant in which nine year old...
COLE, in his underwear, leans back on a large rock beside the
Ford, his pants hanging on the car's open door. He's staring up
at the sun and the sky. RAILLY finishes bandaging his thigh.
RAILLY
You shouldn't put your weight on it.
You need stitches and antibiotics.
Lucky for you it was near the surface.
RAILLY wraps the bullet in some gauze and sticks it in her pocket
while COLE continues staring up at the sky.
COLE
I love seeing the sun.
A beat. COLE tries to stand up.
RAILLY
Wait -- let me help you.
RAILLY puts an arm around him and helps him to his feet. A beat.
They're very close. They don't move. RAILLY looks like she can
barely breathe.
COLE
(leans closer, shuts his eyes)
You smell so good.
RAILLY
(trying to concentrate)
You have to give yourself up, you know.
A beat. The spell is broken. He reaches for his pants, then
turns back to her, suddenly grim.
COLE
I have to do something now. Something
I don't want to do. I'm so sorry.
RAILLY reacts, sudden fear in her eyes. He looms over her. He's
cold now, steeled.
COLE
I have a mission. It's important.
RAILLY steps back...horrified, realizing she's going to die.
EXT. MASON MANSION - NIGHT
A SECRET SERVICE AGENT ambles vigilantly among the rows of luxury
cars parked beside the brightly-lit rural mansion. Encountering
another AGENT, he pauses.
FIRST AGENT
They find him?
SECOND AGENT
Who??
FIRST AGENT
That kid. The one in the pipe.
SECOND AGENT
You believe this? They're dropping a monkey
down there with a miniature infra-red camera
strapped on him and a roast beef sandwich
wrapped in tinfoil.
FIRST AGENT
You're making that up!
ANGLE UNDER A PARKED MERCEDES, where COLE is hiding, listening to
the receding VOICES of the AGENTS.
SECOND AGENT (o.s.)
I shit you not. ... Man, life is weird!
A monkey and a sandwich. Wonder who
thought that one up.
FIRST AGENT (o.s.)
Probly give the sonafabitch a Nobel
Prize!
Quickly, COLE rolls to the next car and under it. He doesn't
see...the pistol fell out of his pocket, under the Mercedes.
INT. MASON MANSION/DINING ROOM - NIGHT
A formal dinner for forty. Desert has been served. DR. MALCOLM
MASON rises to the enthusiastic applause of the GUESTS.
DR. MASON
Would that I could enjoy this opulent
dinner and this excellent and
stimulating company for itself, with no
sense of purpose. But alas, I am
""burdened"" with the sense that with all
this excess of public attention and
this cacophony of praise, there comes
great responsibility. Indeed, I
practically feel a soapbox growing
under my feet whenever I stand for more
than a few seconds.
While GUESTS laugh at DR. MASON'S last remark, SECRET SERVICE
AGENT #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.
DR. MASON (o.s.)
The dangers of science are a time worn
threat, from Prometheus stealing fire
from the Gods to the Cold War era of
the Dr. Strangelove Terror.
AGENT #3 spots who he's looking for. JEFFREY MASON!
DR. MASON (cont.)
But never before, not even at Los Alamos
when the scientists made bets on whether
their first atomic bomb test would wipe out
New Mexico, has science given us so much
reason to fear the power we have at hand.
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, as AGENT #3 whispers in his ear.
JEFFREY
What are you talking about? What
friend? I'm not expecting anyone.
ANGLE ON DR. MASON, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.
DR. MASON
Current genetic engineering as well as
my own work with viruses has presented
us with powers as terrifying as any...
ANGLE ON JEFFREY, following the AGENT out of the dining room,
grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.
JEFFREY
This is ridiculous. My father is
making a major address.
INT. HALLWAY/MASON MANSION
The conversation continues as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the hall.
AGENT #3
Normally if we caught a guy sneaking
around like this with no I.D., we'd
bust his ass, excuse the French, but
this one said he knows you...
(smirk, smirk)
-- and, since you seem to have had
some...uh...unusual...uh...""associates"",
we certainly didn't want to arrest one
of your, uh, closest...pals.
INT. LIBRARY/MASON MANSION
COLE, smudged with dirt and car grease, sitting in the shadows in
a wingback chair, looks up as JEFFREY and AGENT #3 enter the
room. A FOURTH AGENT looms beside the wingback chair.
JEFFREY
(dismissing Cole casually)
Never saw him before in my life. Go
ahead and shoot him or torture him or
whatever it is you do.
COLE
(rising)
You do know me. You helped me once.
JEFFREY
(turning to leave)
That would be totally out of character.
Helping people is against my principles.
(to the Agents)
See, he definitely doesn't know me. Now,
I'm going to go back and listen to my
father's very eloquent discourse on the
perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS
INTRUDER TO DEATH.
COLE
I'm here about some monkeys.
Halfway out the door, JEFFREY freezes. A beat.
JEFFREY
Excuse me -- what did you say?
COLE
Monkeys. Twelve of them.
JEFFREY frowns, turns, considers COLE. Then, suddenly, JEFFREY
rushes to COLE and embraces him.
JEFFREY
Arnold...Arnold.
COLE is astonished. The AGENTS are, too.
JEFFREY
(stepping back)
My God, Arnie, what's happened to you?
You look like shit
AGENT #3
(dubious)
You know this man?
JEFFREY
Of course I know him. What do you
think -- I act like this to strangers?
Listen -- you fellas are terrific. I
thought you were pulling a number on
me. What a terrible thing if you'd
thrown old Arnie out. I owe you guys
the big apologia! Mea culpa, fellas.
(turning to Cole)
Christ, Arnie, it's black tie! I mean,
I said, ""drop by,"" but, like, this is
Dad's big ""do""...vips, senators, secret
service, and...and everything.
JEFFREY throws an arm around COLE'S shoulder and starts leading
him toward the door as the two AGENTS exchange narrow-eyed looks.
AGENT #4
""Arnie?""
JEFFREY
Arnold Pettibone. Old Arnie Pettibone.
Used to be my best friend. Still is.
What've you lost, Arnie -- forty pounds?
No wonder I didn't know you. You hungry?
Lots of dead cow, dead lamb, dead pig.
Real killer feast we're putting on tonight.
The AGENTS watch JEFFREY lead the limping, disheveled COLE out.
AGENT #4
These people -- all of 'em -- are true
weirdoes!
AGENT #3
(moving to the phone)
I'm gonna call in a description of this
""Pettibone"" character. You go keep an
eye on him. Make sure he doesn't do
one of the guests with a fork.
INT. HALLWAY/MASON MANSION
GUESTS pouring from the dining room into the hall meet JEFFREY
and a very disconcerted COLE.
JEFFREY
Hey, nice ta see ya. Lookin' good! Hi,
there. Yes, it has been a long time.
In the b.g., too far away to hear them, AGENT #4 trails JEFFREY and
COLE as they maneuver through the GUESTS toward the grand staircase.
JEFFREY
(whispers to Cole)
County Hospital, right? 1989. The
""Immaculate Escape"" -- am I right?
(smiling to guests)
Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
COLE
Listen to me -- I can't do anything
about what you're going to do. I can't
change anything. I can't stop you. I
just want some information...
JEFFREY
We need to talk. Come on. Upstairs.
(to a guest)
I am a new person! I'm completely
adjusted. Witness the tux. It's Armani.
(whispers to Cole)
Who chattered? Goines? Weller?
COLE
I just need to have access to the pure
virus, that's all! For the future!
JEFFREY studies COLE. COLE doesn't just talk crazy. He looks crazy!
JEFFREY
Come on, follow me. You don't lock so good.
JEFFREY starts guiding COLE up the grand staircase as COLE, glancing
back, spots AGENT #3 and AGENT #4, both keeping an eye on him now.
COLE
I don't have time to go upstairs. The
police are looking for me. I need to
know where it is and exactly what it is.
JEFFREY
(brightening suddenly)
I get it! This is your old plan, right?
COLE
Plan? What are you talking about?
JEFFREY
Remember? We were in the dayroom,
watching TV, and you were all upset
about the...desecration of the planet.
And you said to me, ""Wouldn't it be
great if there was a germ or a virus
that could wipe out mankind and leave
the plants and animals just as they
are?"" You do remember that, don't you?
COLE
Bulishit! You're fucking with my head!
JEFFREY
And that's when I told you my father was
this famous virologist and you said, ""Hey,
he could make a germ and we could steal it!""
COLE
(grabbing Jeffrey)
Listen, you dumb fuck! The thing mutates
We live underground! The world belongs
to the fucking dogs and cats. We're
like moles or worms. All we want to do
is study the original...
AGENT #4'S VOICE
Okay -- take it easy. We know who you
are, Mr. Cole.
COLE feels a firm grip on his shoulder, turns and sees AGERT #4
AGENT #4
Let's go somewhere and talk this thing
over. Okay? Just come with me...
JEFFREY
You're right! Absolutely right. Me's
a nut case, totally deranged. Delusional!
Paranoid. HIS PROCESSOR'S ALL FUCKED
UP, HIS INFORMATION TRAY IS JAMMED.
AGENT #4 is wishing JEFFREY would chill out even as the THIRD
AGENT is climbing up the staircase to help.
COLE is like a trapped animal. He's being led down the staircase
now with JEFFREY, right on his heels, yelling so EVERYONE can hear.
JEFFREY
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, THE ""ARMY OF THE
TWELVE MONKEYS""? IT'S A COLLECTION OF
NATURE KOOKS WHO RUN A STORE DOWNTOWN.
SPACE-CASE DO-GOODERS SAVING RAIN
FORESTS. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH
THOSE BOZOS ANYMORE. I QUIT BEING THE
RICH KID FALL GUY FOR A BUNCH OF
INEFFECTUAL BANANAS. SO MUCH FOR YOUR
GRAND PLOT!
COLE stares back at JEFFREY as both AGENTS hustle COLE down the
stairs. It sounds true! JEFFREY'S so confident.
AGENT #3
Take it easy, Mr. Mason, we've got him.
Everything's...
JEFFREY
MY FATHER HAS BEEN WARNING PEOPLE ABOUT
THE DANGERS OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH
VIRUSES AND DNA FOR YEARS. YOU'VE
""PROCESSED"" THAT INFORMATION THROUGH
YOUR ADDLED PARANOID INFRA-STRUCTURE AND
LO AND BEHOLD, I'M FRANKENSTEIN AND THE
""ARMY OF THE TWELVE MONKEYS"" BECOMES
SOME SORT OF SINISTER REVOLUTIONARY
CABAL. THIS MAN IS TOTALLY BATSHIT! YOU
KNOW WHERE HE THINKS HE COMES FROM???
Suddenly, COLE, catching the AGENTS by surprise, wrenches free,
shoves them aside, and stumbles down the rest of the staircase.
INT. FOYER/MASON MANSION
COLE heads for the front door, but there's an AGENT there! COLE
turns and limps madly toward the dining room, pushing his way
through the crowd of amazed GUESTS.
INT. DINING ROOM/MASON MANSION
SERVANTS, clearing the table, look up astonished as two AGENTS
burst into the room.
AGENT #4
Did a man just come through here...limping?
INT. KITCHEN/MASON MANSION
COOKS stare, amazed, as two OTHER AGENTS burst into the kitchen
and look about urgently.
INT. DEN/MASON MANSION
A large projection TV is on and a knot of GUESTS is gathered in
front of it...watching the spooky VIDEO IMAGES.
TV REPORTER (v.o.)
These pictures we are seeing are coming
to us live from deep inside the pipe.
You can just make out the metal wall
behind those roots and I guess those
must be spider webs.
MRS. McCANN, a guest, watching the TV, expresses concern...
MRS. McCANN
Well, if you ask me, I think that monkey
is going to eat the sandwich himself.
Just then, two AGENTS burst into the den.
The GUESTS turn from the TV, startled, stare open-mouthed, but
the AGENTS have spotted an open window and are hurrying to it.
AGENTS POV OUT THE WINDOW: the rows of expensive parked CARS.
ON THE TV SCREEN, RAILLY'S photograph appears.
TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
This just in: Police say that the body of
a woman found strangled in the Knutson state
Park could be kidnap victim, Dr. Kathryn Railly.
As the AGENTS run out of the room, a photo of RAILLY'S abandoned
Acura comes up on the TV screen.
TV ANCHOR (v.o.)
Earlier in the day, police located
Railly's abandoned car not far from a
building where three animal rights
activists were found bound and gagged...
EXT. MASON MANSION - MINUTES LATER (NIGHT)
Pistols drawn, AGENTS move cautiously among the rows of parked
luxury cars, checking inside and under the vehicles.
AN AGENT'S VOICE (o.s.)
COME ON OUT, MR COLE -- WE'RE NOT GOING
TO HURT YOU.
INT. PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
COLE, scrunched down on the floor next to the driver's seat,
spots the key dangling from the ignition, then lifts his head
slightly to study the shift mechanism, trying to figure it out.
EXT. PARKED CARS/MASON MANSION
AGENTS continue to move cautiously among the parked cars.
INT. PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
COLE eases himself into the driver's seat, tentatively slides the
shift into ""Drive"", then turns the key. Nothing happens.
Panic. COLE studies the shift again.
EXT. PARKED CARS/MANSION
AGENT #5 approaches the row where the Jaguar is parked.
INT. PARKED GREEN JAGUAR
COLE slides the shift from D (Drive) to N (Neutral). He twists
the key again. The engine ROARS...SEVEN THOUSAND RPM!
EXT. LAWN/MANSION
AGENT #5 whirls at the sound.
SMASH. The JAGUAR clips the Mercedes parked in front of it and
accelerates right at him!
AGENT #5 dives aside just as the speeding JAGUAR whizzes past
him, slams into a parked Cadillac, bounces off, grinds between
two other parked vehicles with a fierce scream of tearing metal.
INT. MOVING JAGUAR
Caught between two cars, COLE can only lean on the gas pedal.
The JAGUAR comes free with a great SCCCREEEEECH...
COLE sees the driveway ahead in the moonlight. Steering madly,
he plows through shrubs and gardens heading for the driveway.
EXT. MASON MANSION - NIGHT
Lights off, veering wildly, the JAGUAR reaches the driveway.
AGENTS are leaping into cars and a HELICOPTER is coming to life,
its rotors whipping around.
INT. SPEEDING JAGUAR/OUTERHRIDGE ?OAD - NIGHT
COLE turns onto the road, careening crazily from one side to the
other, unable to see ahead with no headlights.
COLE
LIGHTS! LIGHTS!
He starts hitting switches. The wipers come on, the RADIO BLARES.
RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
---when they pulled the monkey out, it
was still clutching the tinfoil wrapped
sandwich.
Rounding a bend, an ONCOMING CAR heads straight at COLE.
COLE yanks the wheel as the OTHER CAR, horn BLARING, just misses him.
Recovering, COLE loses the road, speeds crazily along the shoulder.
INT. FLYING HELICOPTER - NIGHT
The PILOT, an agent, steers the chopper while the CO-PILOT pans a
spotlight over the two lane road beneath them.
Just then, the PILOT sees headlights below.
PILOT
There! He's showing lights.
INT. SPEEDING JAGUAR - NIGHT
COLE can see the road now in his headlights as the windshield
wipers scrape frantically and the RADIO BLARES...
RADIO REPORTER'S VOICE/RADIO (o.s.)
We don't know what to think. They
didn't locate him and they don't know
how much longer he can last, that's
assuming the boy is still alive.
A spotlight hits the car and COLE hears the sound of the
HELICOPTER as it lowers over him!
EXT. OUTERBRIDGE ROAD
The HELICOPTER maneuvers over the speeding JAGUAR.
INT. SPEEDING JAGUAR
COLE can see the underbelly of the HELICOPTER a few feet above
his front windshield.
Desperate, he yanks the wheel hard, veering off the road.
COLE'S POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: dense woods ahead.
EXT. HELICOPTER/WOODS
The chopper pulls up sharply, avoiding the trees, then levels out.
INT. HELICOPTER
The PILOT skims the top of the trees while the CO-PILOT rakes the
forest below with his spotlight.
PILOT
Goddamnit! Where is he?
The CO-PILOT gets a brief glimpse of headlights through the leaves.
CO-PILOT
There! Over there.
PILOT
Where?
CO-PILOT
Eight o'clock! He was right there.
The headlights are gone. Nothing but darkness below.
PILOT
He musta turned his lights of if.
CO-PILOT
Couldn't drive down there without
lights. We just can't see 'em.
PILOT
Maybe he's not driving!
EXT. WOODS - LATER (NIGHT)
A weather forecast BLARES from the radio of the steaming Jaguar,
crumpled into a tree, the driver's door open.
A POLICE OFFICER, pistol drawn, approaches the car cautiously, as
OTHER OFFICERS and AGENTS stay behind trees, weapons ready.
The POLICE OFFICER lunges forward, pointing his weapon into the
Jaguar. He inspects the car, then turns and calls out...
POLICE OFFICER
He's not in here.
EXT. WOODS/CLEARING - NIGHT
Limping, bleeding from various cuts, COLE CRASHES through
underbrush as he follows a stream through the woods.
Suddenly, he sees what he's looking for.
The FORD...barely visible in the moonlight, parked in the trees
beside the stream. The car looks empty.
INT. TRUNK/FORD
Total blackness! The sound of keys in the lock.
Then, the trunk swings open and COLE stands in the moonlight,
looking down
RAILLY is in the trunk, tears of rage and frustration in her eyes.
RAILLY
You bastard! You total bastard!
EXT. FORD
COLE backs away, as RAILLY scrambles out of the trunk, swinging.
He slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.
RAILLY
I could have died in there. If something
had happened to you I would have died.
COLE is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.
COLE
I...I...I'm really sorry.
Noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.
RAILLY
What have you done? Did you...kill someone?
COLE
(getting to his feet)
No! I...don't think so. I stole a car
and they chased me. I hit a tree.
RAILLY
See -- you can drive after all!
COLE
Yeah, sort of, I guess. I...I'm sorry
I locked you up. I thought...I thought...
I think maybe I am crazy!
She looks at him. Breakthrough? Very calm now, the doctor.
RAILLY
What made you think that?
COLE
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about
the virus. And suddenly, I wasn't
sure. We talked when I was in the
institution, and it was all...fuzzy.
The drugs and stuff.
(horrified)
You think maybe I'm the one who wiped
out the human race? It was my idea?
RAILLY
Nobody is going to wipe out the human
race. Not you or Jeffrey or anybody
else. You've created something in your
mind, James -- a substitute reality.
In order to avoid something you don't
want to face.
COLE
I'm...""mentally divergent"". I would
love to believe that.
RAILLY
It can be dealt with, but only if you
want to. I can help you.
COLE reacts to the sound of VOICES in the woods, dogs BARKING.
COLE
I need help all right. They're coming
after me.
RAILLY
First, it's important that you
surrender to them instead of them
catching you running. Okay?
COLE
(brightening)
It would be great if I'm crazy. If I'm
wrong about everything...the world will be
okay. I'll never have to live underground.
RAILLY
Give me the gun.
COLE
The gun! ... I lost it
RAILLY
You're sure?
COLE
(showing her)
No gun!
(looking up)
Stars! Air! I can live here. Breathe!
RAILLY starts around to the front of the car.
RAILLY
I'm going to attract their attention,
let them know where we are, okay?
RAILLY gets in the driver's seat...and starts to HONK the horn.
RAILLY
(calling out)
They'll tell you to put your hands on top
of your head. Do what they tell you. You're
going to get better, James -- I know it!
ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something on the ground. An insect! He
reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass,
stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face. The
HORN BLARES as COLE looks up at the sky.
ANGLE ON THE NIGHT SKY, the moon full, the sky rich with stars.
ANGLE ON COLE, tears of joy running down his face.
COLE
I love this world!
ANGLE ON RAILLY, in the driver's seat, hearing near-by SHOUTS
from the woods. The police are almost here. She gets out of the
car, starts around toward COLE.
RAILLY
Remember, I'm going to help you. I'll
stay with you. I won't let them...
She breaks off mid-sentence...stares, stunned!
COLE is gone. Disappeared.
INT. POLICE STATION OFFICE - MORNING
RAILLY is being ""debriefed"" by POLICE OFFICERS and FBI AGENTS.
RAILLY
Then I said something to him about
cooperating and he said he would do
that, so I got in the car and started
honking the horn. When I got out, he
was gone.
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
You lucked out. For a while we thought
you were a body they found down state...
mutilated.
A COP enters, hands a photo to LIEUTENANT HALPERIN who studies it.
RAILLY
He wouldn't do something like that -- he...
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
(interrupts, hands her the photo)
This the man he attacked?
RAILLY looks at the photo, an 8 x 10 of the FIRST THUG, slumped
against the alley wall, obviously dead.
RAILLY
I'd like to be clear about this. That
man and the other one were...""severely""
beating us. James Cole didn't start
it. In fact -- he saved me!
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
Funny thing, Doctor, maybe you can
explain it to me, you being a psychiatrist
-- why do kidnap victims almost always
try to tell us about the guys who grabbed
'em and try to make us understand how
kind these bastards really were?
RAILLY
(as if reciting)
It's a normal reaction to a life-
threatening situation.
(suddenly animated)
He's sick. He thinks he comes from the
future. He's been living in a carefully
constructed fantasy world and that world
is starting to disintegrate. He needs
help!
INT. AIRPORT CONCOURSE/THE DREAM
YOUNG COLE stares, eyes wide.
He sees the BRUNETTE, cradling the head of the BLONDE MAN as he
sprawls on the concourse...
ASTROPHYSICIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
Wake up! Wake up!
GEOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
I think we gave him too much.
MICROBIOLOGIST'S VOICE (O.S.)
WAKE UP, PRISONER!
INT. SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
COLE blinks awake. All he can see are blurry faces hovering over
him, hammering him with questions.
ASTROPHYSICIST
Come on, Cole, cooperate!
GEOLOGIST
Spit it out... you went to the home of
a famous virologist...
COLE
(weakly)
You...don't...exist! You're in
my mind...
SCIENTISTS (IN RAPID SUCCESSION)
What? What's that? What did he say? His
brain's fried. Give him another shot!
SPEAK UP, COLE. WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT?
INT. RAILLY'S APARTMENT - EVENING
The TV shows film of RAILLY leaving the police station.
TV REPORTER (v.o.)
The kidnap victim seemed exhausted but
apparently unharmed by her 30 hour ordeal
as she left the police station in
Philadelphia this morning. So far she
has refused to make a public statement.
RAILLY'S friends, MARILOU and WAYNE, are watching the TV.
A door opens and KATHRYN RAILLY, wearing a robe, comes out of her
bedroom. She still looks exhausted Followed by her cat, she
enters the kitchen area and turns on the kettle as WAYNE hastily
turns down the TV.
WAYNE
Sorry.
RAILLY
No -- I'm in a state of hyper-
alertness. I can't sleep.
MARILOU
Did you take the sedative?
RAILLY
I hate those things. They mess my head
up.
The old mug shot of COLE appears on the screen and RAILLY remotes
the volume up.
TV REPORTER (v.o.)
Along with the kidnapping of the Baltimore
woman, James Cole is now also wanted in
connection with the brutal slaying of
Rodney Wiggins, an ex-convict from...
RAILLY goes to the window, pushes aside the drape, and sees...
HER POV: ACROSS THE STREET...A COP keeps watch.
RAILLY (o.s.)
Do they really expect him to come here?
RAILLY returns to the kitchen area where MARILOU is getting the
tea things out.
TV REPORTER on air
And in Fresno, California...
RAILLY
(glances sadly toward the TV)
He's dead, isn't he -- that little boy?
WAYNE
He's fine. It was just a ""prank"" he
and his friends pulled.
CLOSE ON RAILLY'S FACE... SHOCKED.
ANGLE ON THE TV SCREEN, showing footage of a sheepish nine year
old boy being led out of a barn by the police. The cops look grim.
TV REPORTER (v.o.)
Authorities have so far been noncommittal
about whether they will try to file
charges against the families of the
children involved in the hoax.
RAILLY stares at the TV, stunned.
INT. ""HOSPITAL"" ROOM - ETERNAL NIGHT
VOICES! SINGING! COLE blinks awake, looks around, confused, then
stares in disbelief....
Crowded around COLE'S bed, the SCIENTISTS are concluding a
ragged, out of tune, rendition of ""BLUEBERRY HILL.""
SCIENTISTS
---found my thrills on Blueberry Hill...
Seeing he's awake, SCIENTISTS break off the song and applaud.
SCIENTISTS
Well done, James! Well done! Nice
going! Congratulations! Good for you!
BOTANIST
During your ""interview,"" while you
were...""under the influence,"" you told
us you liked music!
COLE, confused, looks around, sees he's in a one-bed windowless
room adorned with cheap reproductions of 19th and 20th century
landscapes.
The BOTANIST responds to COLE'S obvious disbelief with a
friendly smile and the others join in rapid fire, overlapping.
ZOOLOGIST
This isn't the prison, James.
BOTANIST
This is a hospital.
ASTROPHYSICIST
But just until you recover your,
uh,... equilibrium.
ENGINEER
You're still a little... disoriented.
GEOLOGIST
Stress! Time travel!
ASTROPHYSICIST
You stood up very well, considering...
GEOLOGIST
Superior work! Superior!
BOTANIST
You connected the Army of the 12
Monkeys to a world famous virologist
and his son...
MICROBIOLOGIST
Others will take over now...
ZOOLOGIST
We'll be back on the surface in a
matter of months....
GEOLOGIST
We'll retake the planet.
ASTROPHYSICIST
We're very close! Because of you!
ENGINEER
(unrolling a document)
This is it, James...what you've been
working for.
BOTANIST
A full pardon!
MICROBIOLOGIST
You'll be out of here in no time.
ASTROPHYSICIST
Women will want to get to know you...
COLE
I DON'T WANT YOUR ""WOMEN,"" YOU
BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
Unseen until now, two guards, TINY and SCARFACE, suddenly break
through the ring of SCIENTISTS, push COLE down, and tighten the
loose restraints, already in place, but unnoticed before.
ASTROPHYSICIST
(sympathetically)
Of course you want to be well, James.
And you will be...soon.
COLE bursts into hysterical laughter.
COLE
YOU DON'T EXIST, YOU SILLY BOZOS!
YOU'RE NOT REAL! HA HA HA! PEOPLE DON'T
TRAVEL IN TIME! YOU AREN'T HERE.
MADE YOU UP! YOU CAN'T TRICK ME!
YOU'RE IN MY MIND! I'M INSANE AND
YOU'RE MY INSANITY!
INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY
CLOSE ON KATHRYN RAILLY, insisting fiercely to someone,
RAILLY
He not only used the word ""prank"" -- he
said the boy was hiding in a barn.
RAILLY's talking to her former boss, DR. OWEN FLETCHER, psychiatrist
sitting across from her in his office, tapping his pen.
DR. FLETCHER
He kidnapped you, Kathryn. You saw him
murder someone. You knew there was a real
possibility he would kill you, too. You
were under tremendous emotional stress.
RAILLY
For God sakes, Owen, listen to me -- he
knew about the boy in Fresno and he says
three billion people are going to die!
DR. FLETCHER
Kathryn, you know he can't possibly
know that. You're a rational person.
You're a trained psychiatrist. You
know the difference between what's real
and what's not.
RAILLY
And what we believe is what's accepted as
""truth"" now, isn't it, Owen? Psychiatry --
it's the latest religion. And we're the
priests -- we decide what's right and what's
wrong --we decide who's crazy and who isn't. ...
I'm in trouble, Owen. I'm losing my faith.
INT. ""HOSPITAL"" CELL - ETERNAL NIGHT
Alone in his ""hospital"" room, COLE struggles without success to
free himself from his restraints.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
You sure fucked up, Bob!
Startled, COLE freezes, then ignores the RASPY VOICE and
continues his feverish struggle.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
But I can understand you don't want
your mistakes pointed out to you. I can
relate to that, old Bob.
COLE looks around in spite of himself. Nothing to see but the
walls and the landscape paintings.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Hey, I know what you're thinking. You're
thinking I don't exist except in your
head. I can see that point of view. But
you could still talk to me, couldn't you?
Carry on a decent conversation?
COLE
(blurting)
I saw you! In 1995! In the real world!
You were a bum! You pulled out your teeth.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Why would I pull out my teeth, Bob?
They don't like that. That's a no-no.
And when did you say you saw me?
In...1872?
COLE
FUCK YOU!
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Yelling won't get you what you want. You
have to be smart to get what you want.
COLE
Oh, yeah? What do I want?
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
You don't know what you want? Sure you
do, Bob. You know what you want.
COLE, agitated, rocks back and forth. Then...
COLE
Tell me. Tell me what I want.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
To see the sky -- and the ocean -- to
be topside -- breathe the air -- to be
with her. ... Isn't that right? Isn't
that what you want?
Completely shaken, COLE hesitates for a long moment. When he
speaks, it comes out of him like air...a whisper.
COLE
More...than...anything.
INT. RAILLY'S BEDROOM - MORNING
RAILLY'S in bed, asleep, having a very bad dream. Suddenly, the
bedside phone RINGS. Her eyes snap open. A beat to orient
herself. RING. She reaches for the phone.
INTERCUT LIEUTENANT HALPERIN'S OFFICE/RAILLY'S BEDROOM
CLOSE ON HALPERIN, at his desk, talking into the phone.
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
Dr. Railly? Jim Halperin, Philly P.D..
Sorry to call so early but...
CLOSE ON RAILLY, eager, concerned. into the phone,
RAILLY
You found him? Is he all right?
CLOSE ON HALPEPIN, noting her reaction with raised eyebrows
giving an ""I told you so"" look to the BLACK PLAINCLOTHES cop
across his desk, then continuing into the phone,
LIEUTENANT HALPERIN
Au contraire, Doctor. No sign of your
good friend, the kidnapper. However,
the plot thickens. I have a ballistic
report on my desk that says the bullet
you claim you removed from Mr. Cole's
thigh is an antique...and all indications
are it was fired...sometime prior to 1920.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, stunned.
ANGLE ON HALPERIN, continuing soberly now,
LIEUTENANT RALPERIN
So what I was thinking was, maybe if I
sent a detective down there to talk
with you, you could maybe revise or
amplify on the circumstances....
Hello? Hello? Dr. Railly?
HALPERIN considers the dead phone, glances at the COP again.
INT. RAILLY'S BEDROOM/STUDY
Her hand still on the receiver, RAILLY looks shocked. Then, she
hurries into her study and starts frantically pulling neatly
arranged piles of papers and books from a bookcase until she
finds a copy of her book. She leafs through it hurriedly,
locates the picture of the Puerto Rican KID (JOSE) in WWI.
Peering closely, she tries to see everything in the picture.
Then, she turns and reaches for a research folder of old
photographs and rummages through it until she finds...!!!
RAILLY
No!
It's an uncropped shot of JOSE being carried on the stretcher in
the trenches. And there in the corner with no helmet, no gas
mask, and just a bit of bare shoulder showing...it's COLE!!!
INT. SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
Clean shaven, clear eyed, COLE sits before the frowning SCIENTISTS.
ASTROPHYSICIST
The food, the sky, the certain, uh,
sexual temptations -- you haven't
become ""addicted"" have you, Cole? To
that ""dying"" world'
COLE
No, sir! I just want to do my part.
To get us back on top...in charge of
the planet. And I have the experience,
I know who the people are...
BIOLOGIST
He really is the most qualified...
GEOLOGIST
But all that...""behavior""...
ASTROPHYSICIST
(to Cole, a little hurt)
You said we weren't ""real,"" Cole...
COLE
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind
was built to exist in two different...
whatever you call it...""dimensions.""
It's stressful, you said it yourselves,
it gets you confused. You don't know
what's real and what's not.
MICROBIOLOGIST
But you know what's real now?
COLE
Yes, sir.
The SCIENTISTS start to confer openly among themselves
GEOLOGIST
He'd have to bone up, catch up to our
research, the latest clues...
ZOOLOGIST
He's proved to be a quick study...
The ASTROPHYSICIST fixes COLE with a sharp, penetrating look.
ASTROPHYSICIST
You can't trick us, you know. It
wouldn't work.
BIOLOGIST
And why would you want to? It'll be
dangerously close to the end.
COLE
I understand. There'd be no point.
ASTROPHYSICIST
We're going to think about it, Cole.
Among ourselves. We'll get back to you.
INT. DR. MASON'S OFFICE - DAY
Standing in front of a wall of glass in his office, overlooking a
hi-tech lab below where WORKERS in white ""space suits"" work
methodically, DR. MASON speaks angrily into a phone. His male
ASSISTANT, whose features we don't see, stops writing a formula
on a blackboard and listens.
DR. MASON
You have reason to believe that my son
may be planning to do what?!!!
INT. RAILLY'S APARTMENT/STUDY
RAILLY, trying to stay calm, is talking to Dr. Mason on the phone.
RAILLY
Please, I know it sounds insane but...
INT. DR. MASON'S OFFICE
Dr. Mason on the phone.
DR. MASON
(into the phone)
I'm afraid this doesn't seem very
professional to me, in fact it's
distressingly unprofessional for some-
one who treated my son briefly (if
indeed you actually are who you say you
are) to take a sudden unsolicited interest
in his mental health six years later,
and to telephone a parent to express
opinions that would be inappropriate...
(breaks off, listens, then)
I don't know anything about ""Monkey
armies"", Doctor. Nothing whatsoever.
If my son ever was involved in...
(listens, then,)
It would be doubly inappropriate to
discuss matters of security with you,
Dr. Railly, but if it will put you at
ease, neither my son nor any other
unauthorized person has access to any
potentially dangerous organisms in this
laboratory. Thank you for your concern.
DR. MASON hangs up angrily and glares.
DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
Dr. ""Kathryn"" Railly????
DR. MASON
The psychiatrist who was kidnapped by
that man who broke into my house. She
seems to have been suddenly struck by
the most preposterous notion about Jeffrey.
DR. MASON'S ASSISTANT (o.s.)
I attended a lecture once...Apocalyptic
visions.
We see Dr. Mason's ASSISTANT now. It's DR. PETERS, the red-
haired man who insisted to Dr. Railly you didn't have to be
insane to think the world was coming to an end.
DR. PETERS (cont.)
Has she succumbed to her own
theoretical...""disease""?
But DR. MASON is lost in thought, not listening.
DR. MASON
Given the nature of our work, we can't ever
be careful enough. I think we should review
our security procedures, perhaps upgrade them.
INT. SCIENTISTS' CHAMBER - ETERNAL NIGHT
COLE is facing the BOTANIST who's using a pointer to indicate
various fading photos and newspaper clippings tacked on the wall.
BOTANIST
Let's consider again our current
information -- if the symptoms were
first detected in Philadelphia on June
28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
COLE
It was released in Philadelphia,
probably on June 14, 1995.
BOTANIST
And it appeared sequentially after that
in...?
With a quick glance at the panel of SCIENTISTS staring at him
from behind the long table, COLE replies like a good pupil,
COLE
San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de
Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok, then Peking.
BOTANIST
Meaning...???
COLE
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia
to San Francisco, then to New Orleans,
Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi,
Bangkok, then Peking.
BOTANIST
And your only goal is...???
COLE
To find out where the virus is so a
qualified scientist can travel back into
the past and study the original virus.
BOTANIST
So that...???
COLE
Uh, so that a vaccine can be developed
that will, uh, allow mankind to reclaim
the surface of the earth.
COLE glances nervously at the suspicious SCIENTISTS as the
BOTANIST switches on a slide projector and projects...
a magazine photo of wall graffiti: ""ATTENTION!!! POLICE ARE
WATCHING! IS THERE A VIRUS? IS THIS THE SOURCE? 3 BILLION DIE?""
BOTANIST (o.s.)
This is from a magazine printed in late
September, 1995. The writer speculated
that this graffiti might be related to
the epidemic that by that time had
already killed thirty million people
world-wide and was getting worse. He
says, certain people, unnamed, were
questioned, but what came of that is not
known. But it is a clue you should pursue.
COLE stares at the picture.
EXT. FAA STOREFRONT - DAY
LOUD BANGING! The storefront window, completely covered with
posters, quivers violently. Images of MONKEYS covered with
electrodes, BABY SEALS being viciously clubbed, DOGS jammed into
tiny cages quiver as somebody beats on the window. It's RAILLY.
RAILLY
IS ANYBODY IN THERE? HELLO? IS
SOMEONE IN THERE? IF YOU'RE IN THERE,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
INT. FAA STORE
JEFFREY, BEN, TEDDY, and two of JEFFREY'S youthful cohorts, SANDY
and KWESKIN, wait motionless beside a heap of cardboard cartons
as FALE peeks out the front window through a slit between posters.
FALE
It's the kidnap woman -- the one who
was with the guy who tied us up.
BEN
What's she doing?
FALE
She's drawing attention to us, that's
what she's doing. ... I don't know what
you're up to this time, Mason, but
you're gonna get us in deep shit!
JEFFREY
Whine, whine, whine. What about walkie
talkies? We used to have walkie talkies.
EXT. FAA STOREFRONT
From littered doorways, DERELICTS sneak peeks at RAILLY as she,
seemingly mad, shakes the doorknob, then hammers on the door.
RAILLY
I SAW YOU! I SAW SOMEONE MOVING. I
KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!
RASPY VOICE (o.s)
Secret experiments!
RAILLY whirls, sees LOUIE, the raspy-voiced toothless derelict.
LOUIE
That's what they do -- secret weird stuff!
RAILLY
You! I know you!
But LOUIE is studying the pictures of the tortured animals now.
LOUIE
Not just on them. Do 'em on people,
too -- down at the shelters. Feed 'em
chemicals 'n take pictures of 'em.
RAILLY
Have you seen James Cole? The man...?
LOUIE
They're watchin' you. Takin' pictures.
RAILLY follows his look.
ANGLE ON AN OLD CHEVY, parked across the street, the PLAINCLOTHES
COP slouched at the wheel, pretending to read a newspaper.
RAILLY
The police. I know. Listen, I need to
talk to James, but he has to be careful
how he contacts me. He mustn't get
caught. Do you understand me?
LOUIS
Uh, yeah, sure. Uh...who's James?
RAILLY
He was with me, he spoke to you.
Several weeks ago. He said you were
from the future...watching him.
LOUIS gives her a look that says, ""I'm outta here!""
But just then, RAILLY spots two TEZNAGE PUNKS surreptitiously
""tagging"" their way along the street with cans of spray paint.
RAILLY stares at the PUNKS.
INT. FAA STORE
FALE watches JEFFREY go over a check list while KWESKIN, SANDY,
and TEDDY organize materials, and BEN peeks out the small opening
between posters at the front window.
JEFFREY
You get the bolt cutters?
KWESKIN
One dozen. They're in the van.
FALE
One dozen bolt cutters! Whadda you
gonna do with one dozen bolt cutters?
JEFFREY
(grins)
You really want to know?
FALE
No! Absolutely not. Don't tell me anything.
BEN
Hey! Do you know what she's doing?
Everybody freezes, looking toward 3EN, who's peeking outside.
Then, except for JEFFREY, they all crowd around BEN to get a look.
POV THROUGH SLIT: a glimpse of RAILLY, spray painting the front
of the store!
TEDDY
What's it say?
BEN
I can't see it.
JEFFREY
(erupting)
WHY DON'T WE FORGET MY GODDAMN
PSYCHIATRIST AND DEAL WITH THE TASK AT
HAND. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
FALE
(spinning around)
Your psychiatrist? Did you just say,
""your psychiatrist""?
JEFFREY
Ex-psychiatrist! Now, what about
flashlights? How many flashlights...?
FALE
That woman is...was...your...
psychiatrist? And now she's spray-
painting our building?
EXT. FAA STOREFRONT/SECOND AVENUE
ANGLE ON SLACK PLAINCLOTHES COP, across the street in the CHEVY,
amazed, watching RAILLY spray painting. He shakes his head wearily.
ANGLZ ON STREET TYPES, inching closer, watching RAILLY with
amazement, too. They include...
an IRISH DRUNK, white haired, red-faced, bloated...
a NATIVE AMERICAN with tormented eyes and a mangled ear...
an AFRICAN AMERICAN with one eye...
the TEENAGED PUNKS...
a WHITE MAN, shabbily dressed, joining the knot of ONLOOKERS,
reacting at the sight of RAILLY. It's COLE! He pushes toward her.
COLE
Kathryn!
RAILLY stops spraying, whips around at the sound of his VOICE.
RAILLY
James!
With a quick glance toward the PLAINCLOTHES COP, RAILLY takes
urgent charge of the situation.
RAILLY
James! That's a policeman. Pretend
you don't know me. If he sees you...
COLE
(turning, looking)
No, I want to turn myself in. Where is he?
(placing his hands on his head)
Don't worry -- it's all okay now. I'm
not crazy any more! I mean, I am
crazy, mentally divergent, actually,
but I know it now and I want you to
help me. I want to get well...
ANGLE on RAILLY, desperately pulling COLE'S hands off his head as
she tries to block the COP'S view of COLE.
RAILLY
James -- put your hands down and listen
to me. Things have changed!
ANGLE ON THE PLAINCLOTHES COP, checking the mug shot of COLE on
his clipboard, then reaching for his radio mike.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting to the COP speaking into his mike: she
tosses the spray paint can aside, grabs COLE and tries to pull
him along...but COLE isn't moving. He's staring at the front of
the FAA Store with disbelief!
RAILLY
James, come on! We have to get out of here!
COLE looks from the wall to the can rolling on the sidewalk,
then back to the wall where RAILLY has sprayed the huge words:
ATTENTION!!! POLICE ARE WATCHING!
IS THERE A VIRUS? IS THIS THE
SOURCE? THREE BILLION DIE?
It's the graffiti COLE saw in the future, in the picture!
COLE
I've seen that...before.
But RAILLY'S total attention is on their dilemma.
RAILLY
James, trust me. We're in terrible
trouble. We have to run.
Very confused, COLE lets her drag him along the sidewalk, past
ONLOOKERS. She looks crazier than he does.
ANGLE ON THE CHEVY, making a sudden, urgent u-turn, almost
colliding with a passing car. BRAKES SQUEAL and a HORN BLARES.
INT. FAA STORE - DAY
ANGLE ON BEN, peeking out, reacting to the drama.
BEN
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her
and some other guy I can't see.
FALE
Hey, no problem, it's probably just
another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's
shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.
(indicating Jeffrey to the others)
This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic
who told his former psychiatrist all his
plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible
schemes, and now who knows what she's
painted out there on our wall?
JEFFREY
WHO CARES WHAT PSYCHIATRISTS WRITE ON
WALLS?
(moves to Fale, jabs him with a finger)
You think I told her about the Army of
the 12 Monkeys? Impossible! Know why,
you pathetically ineffectual and
pusillanimous ""pretend-friend-to-
animals""?! I'll tell you why: because
when I had anything to do with her six
years ago, there was no such thing -- I
hadn't even thought of it yet!
FALE
(triumphant)
Then how come she knows what's going on?
JEFFREY abruptly switches from rage to good humor, adopting a
supercilious smile and a patronizing tone.
JEFFREY
Here's my theory on that. While I was
institutionalized, my brain was studied
exhaustively in the guise of mental health.
I was interrogated, x-rayed, studied
thoroughly. Then, everything about me
was entered into a computer where they
created a model of my mind.
They all stare, mesmerized, at the strutting JEFFREY. Is he
serious? Is he crazy? Doesn't matter -- he's charismatic.
JEFFREY (cont.)
Then, using the computer model, they
generated every thought I could possibly
have in the next, say ten years, which
they then filtered through a probability
matrix to determine everything I was
going to do in that period. So you
see, she knew I was going to lead the
Army of the Twelve Monkeys into the
pages of history before it ever even
occurred to me. She knows everything
I'm ever going to do before I know it
myself. How about that?
JEFFREY smiles smugly into FALE'S flabbergasted face.
JEFFREY
Now I have to get going -- do my part.
You guys check all this stuff out and
load up the van. Make sure you have
everything. I'm outta here.
JEFFREY exits. The others stare at the door.
FALE
He's seriously crazy -- you know that.
EXT. SKID ROW ALLEY - DAY
An overflowing dumpster squats near the mouth of an alley.
The unmarked CHEVY crawls slowly past the alley, the PLAINCLOTHES
COP'S eyes searching everywhere.
Trash stirs in the dumpster and RAILLY'S eyes peer up out of the
torn cardboard boxes, rotting food, and styrofoam litter.
HER POV: the POLICE CAR passes from view.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, emerging from the refuse, hissing,
RAILLY
James! Come on.
A confused COLE emerges from the opposite end of the dumpster,
bits of lettuce in his hair.
COLE
I don't understand what we're doing.
RAILLY
(climbing out of the dumpster)
We're avoiding the police until I
can....talk to you.
COLE
(climbing out after her)
You mean, treat me? Cure me? Kathryn,
those words on the wall -- I've seen
them before... I...I...dreamed them.
But she's not listening. She's peeking out the alley entrance.
RAILLY'S POV: across the street is a run-down skid row hotel,
THE GLOBE, ROOMS WEEKLY, DAILY.
INT. GLOBE HOTEL/LOBBY - MINUTES LATER
The DESK CLERK, an old alkie who hates trouble but finds it often,
stares across the counter suspiciously at RAILLY and COLE.
DESK CLERK
Twenty five bucks an hour.
RAILLY
An hour?!
DESK CLERK
You want quarter hours, go someplace else.
RAILLY
(catches on, pulls out her last bills)
Here's ninety eight. For the night. Deal?
The DESK CLERK squints warily at this turn of events. Then, he
turns, gets a key, turns back and hands it to her.
DESK CLERK
Forty four. Fourth floor, turn right.
Elevator's busted.
RAILLY turns, COLE follows, and they walk quickly to the stairs
passing the stares of gloomy RESIDENTS sitting on torn sofas
chairs in front of an old TV with hideous color.
ANGLE ON THE DESK CLERK, watching RAILLY and COLE climb
stairs. As they disappear from view, he picks up the phone,
punches a number, speaks into the phone.
DESK CLERK
Tommy? This is Charlie at the Globe.
You know if Wallace has a new girl?
Sort of a rookie type? Blonde?
INT. GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44 - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
COLE sits on the lumpy bed in the dingy room, watching RAILLY
pace back and forth like a mad woman.
RAILLY
Okay...you were standing there looking
at the moon...you were eating grass...
then what?
COLE
I thought I was in...prison again.
RAILLY
Just like that? You were in prison?
COLE
No, not really. It's...it's in my
mind. Like you said.
RAILLY
You disappeared! One minute you were
there, the next minute you were gone.
Did you run through the woods?
COLE
I don't know -- I don't remember.
RAILLY
The boy in the well. How did you know
that was just a hoax?
COLE
It was? I didn't...know.
RAILLY
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
COLE
I think I saw a TV show like that when
I was a kid. Where a boy...
RAILLY
IT WASN'T A TV SHOW! IT WAS REAL!
COLE looks at her. She's really upset.
COLE
Well, maybe that kid saw the same TV
show and copied it. Listen, you were
right, it's all in my head. I'm mentally
ill, I imagine all that stuff. I know
they're not real, I can trick them, make
them do what I want. I just worked on
them in my head and I got back here. I
can get better. I can stay here.
RAILLY pulls a photo from her purse, shows it to COLE.
It's the uncropped picture from her book, the photo of JOSE in
WWI with a fuzzy image of COLE on the edge of the frame,
RAILLY
What does this mean to you?
COLE
...I had a dream about...something
like that.
RAILLY
You had a bullet from World War One in
your leg, James! How did it get there?
COLE
You said I had delusions -- that I
created a world -- you said you could
explain everything...
RAILLY
Well, I can't. ... I mean...I'm trying
to. I can't believe that everything we
do or say has already happened, that we
can't change what's going to happen,
that I'm one of the three billion
people who are going to die...soon.
COLE stands, moves close to her.
COLE
I want to be here. In this time. With
you. I want to become...become a whole
person. I want this to be the present.
I want the future to be unknown.
RAILLY
(sudden hopeful idea!)
James...do you remember...six years
ago...you had a phone number! You
tried to call and...
WHAM! The door flies open, kicked violently, the flimsy lock not
holding. A menacing figure stands in the doorway. WALLACE. A
wiry biker-type with jail house tattoos and mean eyes.
COLE and RAILLY are too stunned to say anything as WALLACE looks
them over coldly, insolently, then advances on RAILLY.
WALLACE
This is my territory, bitch!
COLE
(confused, turns to Railly)
Is this real -- or is this one of my
delusions?
RAILLY
This is definitely real:
(to Wallace)
Excuse me, I think we have a little
misunderstanding here...
WALLACE smashes RAILLY in the face. She flies back against the
wall and onto the floor as WALLACE spins around to COLE who is
stepping toward him, but WALLACE is now holding a knife
WALLACE
What're you -- some kind of tough guy?
You wanna be a hero? You gonna try and
mess with me? Come on...
A beat. COLE puts his hands up placatingly as he backs around
WALLACE and moves to RAILLY, whose eye is already swelling.
WALLACE
Now that's a smart boy. But you,
honey, you think you can go 'round
me and peddle your fancy ass in this
part of town, you bet your life we got
what I would call a major goddamn
misunderstandin'.
RAILLY reaches a hand up to COLE for assistance, but, he grabs
her purse instead, swings it around, SMASHES WALLACE in the face
with it, then grabs the pimp's arm and SNAPS it like it was a
twig! The knife clatters to the floor as WALLACE yelps in pain
and COLE slams him to the floor, straddles his chest, retrieves
the near-by knife, and presses it sharply against WALLACE'S neck.
RAILLY
JAMES -- DON'T!
COLE hesitates.
WALLACE
(eyes bulging)
You...heard...her. Don't do it, man.
RAILLY
(gets up, looks around)
Put him in the closet, ... But get his
money first.
COLE
(amazed)
You want me to rob him?
RAILLY
I...I...We need cash, James.
A shadow. RAILLY turns toward the door and glimpses a FACE
disappearing, then hears SHOUTS from the hallway...
SHOUTS (o.s.)
They're killing him! Call the cops.
Being very careful not to move his neck, WALLACE reaches into his
pocket and produces a thick roll of bills, which RAILLY grabs.
WALLACE
You two are crazy. I got friends. You
put me in a closet, they're gonna be
really pissed.
COLE moves off Wallace and, keeping the knife close, yanks him to
his teeth while RAILLY hurries to the window and looks out.
HER POV: A fire escape leads down into an alley.
RAILLY turns just in time to see COLE shove WALLACE into the
bathroom, follow him in, slam the door behind them, and LOCK it.
RAILLY
James, no!
INT. BATHROOM
RAILLY'S VOICE (from the other room)
(rattling the door knob)
James, what are you doing?
WALLACE cowers back against the shower stall.
WALLACE
I have friends, man -- if you cut me...
WALLACE breaks off, bug-eyed, reacting to something we don't see!
WALLACE
What...the...fuck..are you doing???
INT. GLOBE MOTEL ROOM 44
RAILLY is pounding on the bathroom door now as, suddenly, it
opens and COLE steps out, the knife in his right hand, dripping
with blood.
RAILLY
Oh, my God, James. Did you kill him?
COLE shakes his head ""no"" as blood oozes from his mouth.
COLE
Just...just in case. In case I'm not
crazy...
(holds up two bloody molars)
That's how they find us. By our teeth.
(a beat, eye contact)
I don't want them to find me. Ever. I
don't want to go back.
RAILLY's astonishment turns to emotion as it dawns on her the
choice he's made. Given up the future (if it exists, and it's
looking like it does)! Risking his life to be with her! For
this brief time! She's overwhelmed, lips trembling, tears
welling in her eyes. But just then, the SOUNDS of SHOUTS and
feet THUNDERING up the stairs snap her back to reality.
INT. STAIRWELL/GLOBE HOTEL
COPS' boots THUNDER up the stairwell.
INT. ROOM 44/GLOBE HOTEL
In between nervous glances toward the door, RAILLY supervises as
COLE obediently blocks the bathroom door with the bureau.
RAILLY
Push it tight!
WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
NO PROBLEM! I'LL JUST STAY IN HERE!
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
INT. 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY/GLOBE HOTEL
POLICE OFFICERS, led by the PLAINCLOTHES COP, make a cautious
entrance onto the 4th floor, guns drawn.
Seedy HOTEL RESIDENTS point to Room 44, then cower back into
their doorways.
EXT. GLOBE HOTEL FIRE ESCAPE/ALLEY - DAY
COLE and RAILLY clatter down the fire-escape, COLE in the lead.
They come to the end of the metal stairway. It's a long distance
to the ground. COLE jumps down, turns, reaches up to her.
She lets herself down to him. Their eyes meet. He holds her in
his arms for a moment. Then, reluctantly, he puts her down.
They start running down the alley.
INT. GLOBE HOTEL FOURTH FLOOR - DAY
The PLAINCLOTHES COP has his pistol out, his back to the wall
alongside the open doorway to Room 44. The UNIFORMED OFFICERS
are backing him up, weapons drawn.
PLAINCLOTHES COP
POLICE! THROW YOUR WEAPONS OUT AND
COME OUTTA THERE!
No response.
INT. GLOBE HOTEL ROOM 44
The PLAINCLOTHES COP charges into the room in a crouch, pistol
extended in both hands. He pans the gun around the empty room.
HIS POV: the open window...the blood on the floor.
WALLACE'S VOICE (from the bathroom)
HEY! ZAT THE POLICE! I'M AN INNOCENT
VICTIM IN HERE! I WAS ATTACKED BY A
COKED-UP WHORE AND A CRAZY DENTIST!
EXT. BUS STOP/DOWNTOWN - LATE AFTERNOON
A city bus disgorges a stream of PASSENGERS at a stop in the
toney downtown shopping district. Among them, RAILLY looks
furtively left and right, COLE on her heels. She's hidden her
bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody
handkerchief to his mouth.
As he steps to the sidewalk, COLE is overwhelmed by the bustling
city, the tall downtown buildings. His eyes go up.
COLE'S POV: a building, towering toward the sky. A building
with a ledge. The same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!!
ANGLE ON COLE, shaken, as RAILLY ushers him into the recessed
entrance to a store.
RAILLY
Wait here. I'm going to try that phone
number. Let's hope it's nothing!
Dazed by his experience and the flow of SHOPPERS, COLE watches
her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made
intermittent by PEDESTRIANS streaming past him, their FACES
looming frighteningly close.
A BUSINESSMAN jostles COLE, forcing him back against the display
window. Turning, he faces the angry jaws of a BEAR only inches away
Recovering from a jolt of terror, COLE realizes the BEAR is a life-size
toy in the display window. Relieved, he looks back at RAILLY.
COLE'S POV: RAILLY, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into
the phone.
ANGLE ON COLE, startled, as a BUSINESSMAN, mistaking him for a
panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand. Confused, COLE stares
at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating
BUSINESSMAN, but just then he sees RAILLY rushing toward him,
eyes sparkling with happiness, LAUGHING, ebullient.
RAILLY
James! James! It's okay. We're
insane! We're crazy!
COLE doesn't know how to respond, but a PASSERBY gives them a look.
RAILLY
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
COLE
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
RAILLY
(laughing)
No superiors! No scientists. No
people from the future. It's just a
Carpet Cleaning Company. They have
voice mail -- you leave a message
telling them when you want your carpet
cleaned.
COLE
You... you left them a message?
RAILLY
(impishly)
I couldn't resist. I was so relieved.
Wait'll they hear this nutty woman
telling them...they better watch out
for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys...
Looking at her laughing face, COLE is struck with horror as he
realizes the truth! He starts to recite...
COLE
""The Army of the Twelve Monkeys --
they're the ones who are going to do
it. I can't do anything more. The
police are watching me.""
Now she's stunned. She glances back and sees the phone booth
twenty yards away.
RAILLY
You... you couldn't have heard me.
COLE
They got your message, Kathryn. They
played it for me. It was a bad
recording...distorted. I didn't
recognize your voice.
RAILLY'S eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning.
ANGLE ON A UNIFORMED COP, staring out the window of a POLICE
CRUISER as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic.
Noticing something, he reaches for his radio.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, spotting the CRUISER, grabbing COLE, pulling him
into the CROWD.
RAILLY
Come on.
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/MEN'S DEPARTMENT - 6:00 PM
RAILLY, whose sun glasses don't really hide her bruised eye, adds
a man's Hawaiian shirt to the pile of other men's things heaped
on a counter in front of a very suspicious CLERK.
RAILLY
And this.
(turning)
Anything else?
But COLE'S not here. He's a short distance away...staring.
COLE'S POV: aisle after aisle of eager shoppers and a bounty of
brand new consumer goods.
ANGLE ON COLE, remembering another department store, dark and
full of moldering merchandise.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, turning again to the CLERK.
RAILLY
I guess that's it.
CLERK
Shall I put this on your account, Ma'am?
RAILLY
(producing Wallace's roll of bills)
No -- I'll pay cash.
The CLERK stares at the huge roll of bills!
RAILLY
What floor are the wigs on, please?
EXT. PEST CONTROL VAN - NIGHT
Surrounded by stripped and abandoned vehicles, the VAN, with a
PEST CONTROL logo on its side, is parked on a trash-littered
street beside the massive pillars of a towering freeway.
INT. PARKED PEST CONTROL VAN
The VAN is packed with SIX ACTIVISTS, SANDY and KWESKIN among
them, all wearing black. Some of them have climbing gear, tool
belts, all sorts of paraphernalia. KWESKIN is telling his story.
KWESKIN
So then he goes into this incredible riff
about how his shrink, like, replicated
his brain while he was in the nut house.
Turned it into a computer.
WELLER
And Fale believed it?
KWESKIN
Oh, you know Fale! He's like, ""If you
guys get nailed -- and I'm sure you will --
I never saw you before in nay life!""
LAUGHTER from all of them. Then, there's a sharp, rhythmic
series of RAPS on the side door, a signal.
POPE quickly slides the door open. It's JEFFREY...grinning.
Three other activists, GOINES, ICHIOKA, and BRUHNS, stagger out of
the darkness behind JEFFREY, lugging a huge, squirming GARBAGE BAG.
The van occupants react with murmurs of ""Awwwwwright"" and ""Far
out"", then they help maneuver the writhing bag into the van.
Then, JEFFREY and the other three scramble in, too.
JEFFREY
Let's do it!
EXT. VAN/FREEWAY
The PEST CONTROL VAN lumbers up a ramp and onto the freeway.
INT. PEST CONTROL VAN/MOVING
The GARBAGE BAG squirms and grunts as JEFFREY holds a map under a
flashlight and goes over ""the plan"" with the other ACTIVISTS.
JEFFREY
Okay, that's Stage One. In Stage Two,
Monkey Four is over here...
A loud GROAN from the bag distracts the others.
GOINES
What's the harm in opening the bag?
His eyes are taped.
SANDY
Yeah, it's cruel leaving him like that.
JEFFREY
Ah, but cruelty is his specialty.
ICHIOKA
So why should we be like him?
Shrugging cheerfully, JEFFREY tears open the garbage bag revealing
DR. MASON, trussed up, duct tape covering his eyes and mouth.
JEFFREY
Want the full effect?
Grinning wickedly, JEFFREY rips the tape from his father's mouth.
DR. MASON
Jeffrey? I know it's you, Jeffrey. I
recognize your voice.
JEFFREY puts his finger to his lips, silencing everyone.
DR. MASON
JEFFREY??? ... Very well. You're out
of your mind, Jeffrey. I know all
about your insane plan. That woman --
your psychiatrist -- she told me.
JEFFREY raises his eyebrows. This he hadn't expected.
DR. MASON
I didn't believe her -- it seemed too crazy
even for you. But, just in case, I took steps
to make sure you couldn't do it. I took myself
out of the loop! I don't have the code any
more. I don't have access to the virus. So,
go ahead -- torture me, but you can't extract
anything of use to yourself.
The ACTIVISTS are all exchanging puzzled looks.
JEFFREY
What...virus?
DR. MASON
(spins his head toward Jeffrey)
She knew about it, Jeffrey. She knew
you were going to try this.
JEFFREY
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
DR. MASON
You're insane, Jeffrey.
JEFFREY
You ""develop"" viruses and you're calling
me insane? Typical. What does this
virus attack? Don't tell me, you sick
fuck, it doesn't matter.
(to the others)
Have I ever ""developed"" a virus? Do I
put helpless animals in cages and measure
their reactions to electrical stimuli?
Do I inject radioactive substances into
living creatures and examine their
bowel movements? Wow! And I'm crazy!
DR. MASON
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly
are you going to do? I don't have to
tell you I'm afraid.
JEFFREY
THIS IS A FUCKING EXPERIMENT! YOU'RE
OUR HELPLESS LITTLE TEST ANIMAL, DADDY.
GOT THAT? NOW -- WHAT FUCKING VIRUS
HAVE YOU COME UP WITH, YOU DEMENTED
FUCKING MANIAC?
INT. MOVIE SCREEN/THEATER - NIGHT
Spooky BERNARD HERRMAN MUSIC, giant redwoods looming skyward.
It's DAYTIME in Muir Woods. SCOTTY (JAMES STEWART) AND MADELINE
(KIM NOVAK) walk toward a display of a cross cut section of a
redwood tree. We're watching Hitchcock's VERTIGO.
SCOTTY (up on the screen)
Here's a cross section of one of the
old trees that's been cut down.
They look at the lines of the tree marked with cards that say,
""BIRTH OF CHRIST"", ""DISCOVERY OF AMERICA"", ""MAGNA CARTA SIGNED"",
""1066 - BATTLE OF HASTINGS"", and ""1930 TREE CUT DOWN"".
ANGLE ON THE THEATER AUDIENCE, empty seats dimly visible in the
flickering light, a few shadowy MOVIEGOERS scattered here and there.
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, MADELINE pointing, saying with profound melancholy.
MADELINE (up on the screen)
Somewhere in here I was born. And here
-- I die. There's only a moment for
you. You don't notice.
ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE, a shadowy COUPLE near the back of the
theater. WE CAN'T REALLY SEE THEM, but we recognize their VOICES
RAILLY
Here, let me help you.
The theater is briefly illuminated by a very bright scene on the
screen, revealing enough of COLE and RAILLY for us to see she's
doing something to his upper lip while he tries to watch the movie.
COLE
I think I've seen this movie before.
When I was a kid. It was on TV.
RAILLY
(fussing with his upper lip)
Shh -- don't talk. Hold still.
COLE
(moving his head to see the film)
I have seen it, but I don't remember
this part. Funny, it's like what's
happening to us, like the past. The
movie never changes -- it can't change
-- but everytime you see it, it seems
to be different because you're different
-- you notice different things.
RAILLY
If we can't change anything...because
it's already happened, then we ought to
at least smell the flowers.
COLE
Flowers! What flowers?
From the darkness, a MOVIE PATRON makes a SSSSHHHHH shound.
RAILLY
(whispering)
It's an expression. Here...
She's pulling something from a shopping bag at her feet, placing
it on COLE'S head, adjusting it...
COLE
Why are we doing this?
RAILLY
So we can stick our heads out the
window and feel the wind and listen to
the music. So we can appreciate what
we have while we have it. Forgive me,
psychiatrists don't cry.
There are tears in her eyes. They discomfit COLE.
COLE
But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe you're
wrong. Maybe we're both crazy.
RAILLY
In a few weeks, it will have started or
it won't. If there are still baseball
games and traffic jams, armed robberies
and boring TV shows -- we'll be so
happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves
in to the police.
SHADOWY MOVIEGOER
SHHHHHHH
COLE
(whispers)
Where can we hide for a few weeks?
ANGLE ON THE SCREEN, where SCOTTY and MADELINE are in the foreground,
the OCEAN behind them.
RAILLY
You said you'd never seen the ocean...
EXT. GORILLA'S PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
CLOSE ON A GORILLA, by moonlight, angry, a true nightmare vision.
URGENT WHISPERS off screen, RUSTLING SOUNDS. Then, METAL ON METAL.
Only now are we aware that the GORILLA is in an outdoor zoo pen
with phony rocks. Stalking back and forth. Huge. Upset.
CLANK. CLANK. METAL ON METAL. GRUNTS of effort, then, DR.
MASON'S VOICE, plaintive, frightened.
DR. MASON'S VOICE (o.s.)
What are you doing to me? Where are
we? Jeffrey, please...
SANDY'S VOICE (o.s.)
For God's sake, put the tape back on
his mouth!
The GORILLA bellows angrily, beating his chest.
JEFFREY'S VOICE (o.s.)
Forget the tape. The monkey's louder than
he is. You gonna tape the monkey's mouth?
EXT. PANTHERS' PEN/ZOO - NIGHT
Under the full moon, PANTHERS pace back and forth, back and
forth, uttering ominous guttural SNARLS.
EXT. LION'S PEN/ZOO
The KING OF BEASTS gives a deep, fierce ROAR. From the darkness,
unseen ELEPHANTS TRUMPET their response.
EXT. AVIARIES/ZOO
A PANDEMONIUM of WINGS RUSTLING, the sharp metallic CLINKING of
metal on metal, the MUTTER of HUMAN VOICES, then a cacophonous
CRESCENDO of frenzied SCREECHING as PARROTS, COCKATOOS and other
EXOTIC BIRDS careen madly in their cages.
INT. MOVIE THEATER AUDITORIUM
CLOSE ON COLE, dozing fitfully, as the SOUNDS of SCREAMING BIRDS
continue. Suddenly, he comes awake with a start...sees the movie
filling his field of vision.
HIS POV: the MOVIE SCREEN. TIPPI HEDRIN, overwhelmed by
screeching BIRDS in an attic in Hitchcock's THE BIRDS.
ANGLE ON COLE, orienting himself, looking around. Empty seats on
both sides of him. He's alone. He panics.
COLE
Kathryn?!
INT. THEATER LOBBY
A lobby poster boasts ""Classics 24 Hours A Day"" and ""Hitchcock
Festival"". PANNING OFF the poster, passing a SNORING USHER, dead
to the world in an old velvet chair, WE DISCOVER a BRUNETTE in a
tight dress, just hanging up the lobby pay phone. Turning, she
reveals heavy make-up, gaudy costume jewelry, and sun glasses.
She's the BRUNETTE in COLE'S DREAM! Crossing the lobby toward
the auditorium, it's a pleasure to watch her nice body undulate
in the tight dress.
Just then, the auditorium doors burst open and a BLONDE MAN in a
Hawaiian shirt appears, the man from COLE'S DREAM, except this
man's moustache is fixed firmly on his upper lip. The BLONDE MAN
stops, stunned at the sight of the BRUNETTE.
BRUNETTE
We're booked on a 9:30 flight to Key West.
The Brunette is RAILLY, no longer the frazzled professional,
revealed now by her disguise as a sexy babe. The Blonde Man is
COLE! He's confused.
COLE
You were in my dream just now. I
didn't recognize you.
RAILLY
Well, you look pretty different, too.
COLE
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize
it was you. Then...I woke up and I...I
thought you were gone.
RAILLY
(studies him seriously)
I remember you...like this. I feel
I've known you before. I feel I've
always known you.
Their eyes lock. Suddenly, she backs up, gently maneuvering him
with her, past the sleeping USHER, to and through an unlocked,
unmarked door, then closing it behind them.
INT. STORAGE ROOM/MOVIE THEATER
RAILLY and COLE are in a dimly lit cluttered storage room. She
kisses him hungrily amid the brooms, plastic trash barrels, other
janitorial items. COLE responds to her passion as they move
deeper into the room, its walls covered with old movie posters.
Tearing at each other's clothes, they collapse on a rolled
theater curtain among stacks of ancient theater seats.
EXT. SUBURBS - DAWN
The red rim of the rising sun is just becoming visible beyond the
silhouetted roofs of an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood.
The early light is so vague that when a huge SIBERIAN TIGER pads
across a neatly-trimmed lawn, he's more a shadowy vision than
reality. Did we really see him at all?
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAWN
The rising sun flares behind the towering silhouette of an unfinished
building, deserted in the early morning light. High up, a MONKEY
his head around a girder.
Four stories below, other MONKEYS are climbing.
EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAWN
Deserted in the first light of dawn, the stores face each other
across a broad promenade with blank staring windows.
Nothing happens. For a long moment. Then, an AFRICAN BULL
ELEPHANT appears, turning the corner, lumbering toward us along
the promenade, raising his trunk to TRUMPET triumphantly to the
other ELEPHANTS trotting into view behind him.
INT. TAXICAB/CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING
A fiftyish WOMAN CABBIE with white hair and a Southern twang is
at the wheel of the cab.
WOMAN CABBlE
What time's your flight, friends?
In the back seat, COLE, in the blonde wig and moustache, looks to
his companion, the sexy babe in sun glasses and heavy make-up, RAILLY.
RAILLY
Nine thirty
WOMAN CABBIE
Might be tight.
RAILLY
(startled, checks her watch)
Tight? My watch says 7:30.
WOMAN CABBIE
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a
time, but today, gotta take inta account
your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
RAILLY
What? What did you say?
WOMAN CABBIE
Twelve Monkeys, honey. Guess you folks
didn't turn on your radio this morning.
COLE and RAILLY exchange a quick look.
WOMAN CABBIE
Bunch a weirdoes let all the animals outta
the zoo last night. Then they locked up
this big shot scientist in one of the cages.
Scientist's own kid was one a the ones did it!
RAILLY and COLE stare at the cabbie, stunned.
WOMAN CABBlE
Now they got animals all over the
place. Buncha zebras shut down the
thruway 'bout an hour ago and some
kinda thing called an ""e-mu"" it's got
traffic blocked for miles over on 22.
Flabbergasted, RAILLY'S eyes suddenly fill with hope.
RAILLY
That's what they were up to! Freeing
animals!
COLE
On the walls -- they meant the animals
when they said, ""We did it.""
WOMAN CABBIE
You can hear it on the radio all the
stations...
As the WOMAN CAEBIE switches on the RADIO, RA:LLY points and COLE
follows her look.
COLE'S POV: two CHEETAHS, sleek and magnificent against the
cityscape, streaking past the cab at ninety mph!
ANNOUNCER/RADIO (o.s.)
In the meantime, numerous animal rights
activists have joined the chorus
condemning what they're calling the
""loose canon"" activities of Jeffrey
Mason and his Army of the Twelve
Monkeys.
RIGHTS ACTIVIST/RADIO (o.s.)
Can these fools seriously believe that
releasing a captive animal into an
urban environment is being compassionate
to the animal? It's mindlessly cruel,
almost as indefensible as holding the
animal in captivity in the first place.
RAILLY and COLE are watching FLAMINGOS cross the sky against a
backdrop of skyscrapers in silhouette.
RAILLY
Maybe it's going to be okay.
INT. TICKET COUNTER/AIRPORT TERMINAL - MORNING
CLOSY ON copies of the mug shot of COLE and a photo of RAILLY
while the airport P.A. SYSTEM DRONES in the b.g..
REVEAL a DETECTIVE, giving the flyers to the uniformed SUPERVISOR
at one end of the ticket counter.
DETECTIVE
Tell your people if they spot either
one of them, not to try and apprehend
then. They should notify us and...
ANGLE ON RAILLY AND COLE, thirty yards away, entering the terminal.
P.A. SYSTEM
-- Flight 531 for Chicago is now ready
for boarding at Gate Seventeen.
ANGLE ON COLE, reacting to the P.A., stopping, seeing the
bustling airport lobby.
COLE
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
RAILLY
Airports all look the same. Maybe
it's...
(turning, reacting)
James! Your moustache! It's slipping.
But COLE isn't listening. He's looking around, mesmerized.
COLE
It's not just my dream. I was actually
here! I remember now. My parents
brought me to meet my uncle. About a
week or two before...before...before
everybody started dying.
RAILLY glances around nervously.
RAILLY'S POV: two UNIFORMED POLICEMEN, strolling through the
lobby, their eyes scanning the faces of TRAVELERS.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, pulling a small tube from her purse.
RAILLY
They may be looking for us, James.
(placing the tube in his hand)
Use this. You can fix it in the Men's Room.
COLE
(confounded)
I was here...as a kid. I think you
were here, too. But you...looked just
like you look now.
RAILLY
(getting desperate)
James, if we're identified, they're
going to send us someplace...but not to
Key West!
COLE
(snaps out of it, hand to moustache)
Right! You're right. I have to fix this.
RAILLY
(indicating a sign)
I'll get the tickets and meet you... in
the Gift Shop.
COLE follows her look, nods, then heads for the Men's Room as
RAILLY, in sun glasses, gaudy outfit, high heels, starts clip
clopping toward the ticket counter, her ass attracting admiring
glances.
INT. TELEPHONES/LOBBY - DAY
BUSINESS TRAVELERS huddle over pay phones, talking earnestly, as
COLE walks past on his way to the Men's Room.
Seeing an unoccupied phone, COLE hesitates, considers it. Coming
to a decision, he reaches into his pocket, pulls out some change.
INT. TZCKET COUNTER/TERMINAL
CLOSE ON the flyer of COLE and RAILLY taped under the counter,
hidden from the customers, but in clear view of the TICKET AGENT
who has just finished serving a PORTLY GENTLEMAN. The GENTLEMAN
walks away.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, stepping up to the counter, smiling, looking
nothing like the Railly on the flyer.
RAILLY
Judy Simmons. I have reservations for
Key West.
INT. PAY PHONES/TERMINAL
COLE is speaking into the phone very low, very private, very intense.
COLE
Listen, I don't know whether you're
there or not. Maybe you just clean
carpets. If you do, you're lucky --
you're gonna live a long, happy life.
But if you other guys exist and you're
picking this up -- forget about the
Army of The Twelve Monkeys -- they
didn't do it. It was a mistake'
Someone else did it. The Army of The
Twelve Monkeys are just dumb kids
playing revolutionaries. It was
someone else!
COLE looks around nervously, catches a BUSINESSMAN at the next
phone looking away quickly. COLE touches his loose moustache as
he averts his face and speaks into the phone in an urgent whisper.
COLE
I've done my job. I did what you wanted.
Good luck. I'm not coming back!
COLE hangs up the phone, looks around, catches a few stares.
Averting his face, he heads for the Men's Room.
INT. TICKET COUNTER - DAY
The TICKET AGENT is counting out a stack of bills.
TICKET AGENT
Don't see a lot of this... cash.
RAILLY
It's...a long story.
TICKET AGENT
(smiles, hands over the tickets)
They'll begin boarding in about twenty
minutes. Have a nice flight, Mrs. Simmons.
Turning to go, RAILLY fumbles the tickets while trying to put
them in her purse and they flutter to the floor. As she kneels
to retrieve them, WE SEE the long line of waiting TRAVELERS from
the waist down. WE SEE a familiar Chicago Bulls Sports Bag
resting on the floor beside sneakers and gaudy baggy pants.
we've seen this outfit before...in COLE'S dream...on MR. PONYTAIL!
INT. MEN'S ROOM/AIRPORT - DAY
The P.A. DRONES as CCLE, head down, lingers at a sink, washing
and rewashing his hands while another TRAVELER finishes drying
his hands, gives COLE a quizzical look, then leaves.
Quickly, COLE glances around, checks the seemingly empty Men's
Room, then takes the tube of adhesive from his pocket, puts some
goop under the loose edge of his moustache and presses it firmly
against his face as he leans close to the mirror.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Got yourself a prob, Bob?
COLE whirls, looks for the source of the VOICE. Nothing! Until
he spots shoes peeking from dropped trousers indicating an
occupied stall. It must be him!
COLE
Leave me alone! I made a report. I
didn't have to do that.
RASPY VOICE (o.s.)
Point of fact -- you don't belong here.
It's not permitted to let you stay.
A toilet FLUSHES in the ""occupied"" stall. COLE'S answer is loud
and defiant.
COLE
This is the present. This is not the past.
This is not the future. This is right now!
A PLUMP BUSINESSMAN emerges from the ""occupied"" stall, gives COLE
a wary look and a wide berth as he heads for a sink.
COLE
I'm staying here! You got that? You
can't stop me!
PLUMP MAN
(high pitched voice)
Anything you say, chief. It's none of
my business.
COLE looks dismayed. This guy couldn't be ""THE VOICE""! And there
are no feet showing under the other stalls. Did he imagine it?
INT. TICKET COUNTER - DAY
The Chicago Bulls bag! It's on the counter in front of the
TICKET AGENT who's reviewing a stack of tickets in awe...
TICKET AGENT
Woooo-eeee. San Francisco, New
Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome,
Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking!
That's some trip you're taking, sir,
All in one week!
MR. PONYTAIL (o.s.)
Business.
TICKET AGENT
(handing over the tickets)
Have a good one, sir.
INT. TERMINAL LOBBY
COLE emerges from the Men's Room, shaken, paranoid. He glances
around nervously. Then, keeping his head down, he starts walking
toward the Gift Shop. Before he gets more than a few steps,
someone suddenly grabs his shoulder from behind.
FAMILIAR VOICE (o.s.)
You gotta be crazy, man!
COLE whirls, finds himself facing a Puerto Rican youth in an L.A.
Raiders jacket, a sideways baseball cap, and mirrored sun glasses
COLE
Jo...Jose????
JOSE
Pulling out the tooth, man, that was
nuts! Here, take this.
JOSE tries to slip COLE a 9mm pistol. Astonished, COLE resists!
COLE
What? What for? Are you crazy?
Frustrated, JOSE conceals the gun but keeps a grip on COLE'S arm.
JOSE
Me? Are you kiddin? You're the one!
You were a hero, man. They gave you a
pardon! And whadda you do? You come
back and fuck with your teeth! Wow!
COLE
How did you find me?
JOSE
The phone call, man. The phone call.
COLE
The call I just made? Five minutes ago?
JOSE
Hey, five minutes ago, thirty years ago!
Yes, that phone call. I been in training
for this a couple a months now -- ever
since I got back from that... ""weird""
war we were in. You remember that?
(pressing the pistol on Cole)
Here, take it, man! You could still be
a hero if you'd cooperate!
INT. GIFT SHOP/TERMINAL - DAY
RAILLY takes a travel book on Key West from a rack, considers it,
includes it with several magazines she's holding. She doesn't
notice MR. PONYTAZL enter the Gift Shop behind her!
The P.A. System DRONES flight info as RAILLY checks her watch and
frowns. It's getting late and where's Cole? She turns, heads
for the cash register to make her purchases.
MR. PONYTAIL, seen from behind, is at the cash register already.
He sets a newspaper on the counter and searches for change.
The paper features a banner headline...""ANIMALS SET FREE"" and a
sub head...""PROMINENT SCIENTIST FOUND LOCKED IN GORILLA CAGE""
over a photo of DR. MASON being released from the cage and
another photo of a GORILLA perched atop a parked car.
Stepping in line behind MR. PONYTAIL, RAILLY checks her watch
again. Then, MR. PONYTAIL, having paid, turns to go and RAILLY
looks up and sees his face. though it is not visible to us.
Startled, RAILLY frowns. Does she know this man?
MR. PONYTAIL pauses for a moment, considering the babe in the
shades, gaudy earrings, the tight skirt, and high heels.
RAILLY doesn't recognize the man, but we do! He's DR. MASON'S
ASSISTANT, DR. PETERS...the man who attended RAILLY's lecture!
Smiling, DR. PETERS steps around RAILLY and exits the Gift Shop.
Still puzzled, RAILLY puts her purchases on the counter and the
CLERK starts ringing them up as a DELIVERY MAN comes in and drops
a bundle of newspapers at her feet.
RAILLY'S POV: the front page shows a photo of three frightened
GIRAFFES in freeway gridlock under a headline proclaiming, ""TERRORISTS
CREATE CHAOS"". Further down are two more photos...DR. MASON in the
gorilla cage and a file photo of DR. MASON in his lab.
CLOSE ON THE SHOT OF DR. MASON in his lab. There's someone else
in the picture. It's a man wearing a lab coat and a PONYTAIL!
ANGLE ON RAILLY, reacting, suddenly remembering!
MEMORY FLASHBACK! INT. RECEPTION ROOM/BREITROSE HALL - NIGHT
RAILLY looks up from the book she's signing and sees DR. PETERS.
DR. PETERS
Isn't it obvious that ""Chicken Little""
represents the sane vision and that
Homo Sapiens' motto, ""Let's go shopping!""
is the cry of the true lunatic?
INT. GIFT SHOP - DAY
RAILLY, stunned, stares in the direction PETERS/PONYTAIL went.
RAILLY
Oh, my God!
P.A SYSTEM
-- flight 764 for San Francisco is now
ready for boarding at Gate 36.
INT. LOBBY - DAY
In the confusion of TRAVELERS streaming in different directions,
COLE hurries toward the Gift Shop while JOSE struggles to keep up.
JOSE
Coma on, Cole, don't be an asshole.
(then, blurting it out)
Look, I got orders, man! You know what
I'm sposed to do if you don't go along?
I'm sposed to shoot the lady! You got
that? They said, ""If Cole don't obey
this time, Garcia, you gotta shoot his
girlfriend!""
COLE stops in his tracks, blown away, too stunned to speak.
JOSE
I got no choice, man. These are my
orders. Just take it, okay?
COLE accepts the gun this time, resigned now. They've got him.
COLE
This part isn't about the virus, is it?
JOSE
Hey, man...
COLE
It's about obeying, about doing what
you're told.
JOSE
They gave you a pardon, man. Whatdaya
want?
COLE
Who am I supposed to shoot?
Just then, RAILLY rushes up to COLE, not even noticing JOSE.
RAILLY
James! Thank God! I thought you'd
disappeared. Listen, I think I know
who it is! I saw him! It's Dr. Mason's
assistant. An apocalypse nut! The next
flight to San Francisco leaves from Gate 38.
If he's there, it has to be him.
JOSE, having heard this, steps back into the crowd as RAILLY
grabs COLE and pulls him toward the Security Check Points.
COLE
I love you, Kathryn. Remember that.
She doesn't hear him or see the look of doom in his eyes.
RAILLY
Maybe we can stop him. Maybe we can
actually do something.
INT. SECURITY CHECK POINT/TERMINAL - DAY
A young boy of nine passes through the magnetic arch grinning.
YOUNG COLE! Exactly as he appears in the dream!
He joins his PARENTS, who are only visible from their chests
down, and they continue along the concourse. WE LINGER and
DISCOVER two DETECTIVES watching TRAVELERS as they pass through
the magnetic arch and retrieve their bags from the X-ray machine,
comparing their faces to photos of COLE and RAILLY.
ANGLE ON A SECURITY OFFICER, watching the x-ray monitor.
ANGLE ON THE MONITOR, showing the X-RAY IMAGE of a sports bag moving
along the conveyer belt. The bag contains some strange objects.
ANGLE ON THE SECURITY OFFICER, reacting.
SECURITY OFFICER
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind letting me
have a look at the contents of your bag?
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, coming through the magnetic arch, reacting.
DR. PETERS
Me? Oh, yes, of course. My samples.
I have the appropriate papers.
INT. END OF LINE/SECURITY CHECK POINT
RAILLY AND COLE arrive at the very long suddenly stalled line of
TRAVELERS waiting to pass through security.
RAILLY
Oh, God, we don't have time for this.
ANGLE ON THE SECURITY CHECK POINT, where DR. PETERS unpacks his
Bulls bag, pulls out six metal cylinders along with a change of
clothes and a Walkman.
DR. PETERS
Biological samples. I have the
paperwork right here.
DR. PETERS produces a sheaf of official papers while the SECURITY
OFFICER examines one of the tubes, turning it over in his hands.
SECURITY OFFICER
I'm going to have to ask you to open
this, sir.
DR. PETERS
Open it?
(blinks stupidly, then)
Of course.
DR. PETERS takes the metal cylinder and starts opening it.
There's a SOUND of VOICES RAISED behind them. DR. PETERS pays no
attention, but the SECURITY OFFICER turns toward the NOISE.
SECURITY OFFICER'S POV: RAILLY, trying to explain something to a
SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.
ANGLE ON THE TWO DETECTIVES, nearby, showing interest in the
commotion.
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, oblivious to the fuss, pulling a closed
glass tube out of the metal cylinder.
DR. PETERS
Here! You see? Biological! Check the
papers -- it's all proper. I have a
permit.
SECURITY OFFICER
It's empty!
Indeed, it looks like a sealed clear glass tube with nothing in it.
DR. PETERS
Well, yes, to be sure, it looks empty!
But I assure you, it's not.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, at the end of the line, arguing with the SECOND
SECURITY OFFICER.
RAILLY
Please listen to me -- this is very urgent!
SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
You'll have to get in line, ma'am.
TRAVELER
We're all in a hurry, lady. What's so
special about you?
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, producing the glass tubes from the other
metal cylinders as the SECURITY OFFICER examines the papers.
DR. PETERS
You see! Also invisible to the naked eye.
A beat. OR. PETERS grins suddenly, opens one of the glass tubes,
and waves it under the SECURITY OFFICER'S nose!
DR. PETERS
It doesn't even have an odor.
The SECURITY OFFICER glances up, sees what DR. PETERS is doing,
and smiles as he hands the papers back to the scientist.
SECURITY OFFICER
That's not necessary, sir. Here you
go. Thanks for your cooperation. Have
a good flight.
Hastily, DR. PETERS snatches up all the tubes and cylinders and
shoves them back into his gym bag.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, raging as the SECOND SECURITY OFFICER jabs her
with his finger.
SECOND SECURITY OFFICER
Who are you calling a ""moron""?
COLE
Get your hands off her!
The SECOND SECURITY OFFICER stiffens for trouble.
ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, watching the fuss, ready to get
involved. Suddenly, the FIRST DETECTIVE frowns.
FIRST DETECTIVE9S POV: COLE'S moustache is slipping. COLE
senses it, reaches up to touch it, catches the DETECTIVE'S look.
For half a second their eyes meet, then COLE looks away.
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, hurrying away.
SECURITY OFFICER'S VOICE (o.s.}
HOLD IT! JUST A MOMENT.
DR. PETERS freezes, turns, ashen.
The SECURITY OFFICER is retrieving a pair of jockey shorts from
the floor beside the search table. He waves them at DR. PETERS.
DR. PETERS hurries back for his underpants.
ANGLE ON COLE, trying to keep his head turned away as he
confronts the SECURITY OFFICER.
COLE
I said, get your hands off her. She's
not a criminal. She's a doctor...a
psychiatrist.
RAILLY looks alarmed at that.
ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVES, coming this way. The FIRST DETECTIVE
has the photos in his hand.
ANGLE OW DR. PETERS, bagging his jockey shorts, then starting
hastily down the windowed concourse toward the gates.
ANGLE ON RAZZLY, suddenly spotting DR. PETERS!
RAILLY
THERE HE IS! HE'S CARRYING A DEADLY
VIRUS! STOP HIM!
ANGLE ON COLE, following RAILLY'S look, seeing MR. PONYTAIL, THE
MAN FROM HIS DREAM!
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, frightened, glancing back, walking faster.
RAILLY (o.s.)
PLEASE, SOMEBODY -- STOP HIM!
ANGLE ON DETECTIVES, reaching RAILLY and COLE.
FIRST DETECTIVE
(raising his badge)
Police Officers. Would you step over
here, please.
ANGLE ON COLE, spotting something behind the DETECTIVES!
COLE'S POV: SCARFACE, dressed like a ""businessman""! He gives
COLE a cold look.
A beat. COLE lunges at the SECOND DETECTIVE, knocking him off
balance, then sprints toward the magnetic arch and through it.
The ALARM goes off!!!!
The FIRST SECURITY OFFICER tries to stop COLE, but COLE knocks
him aside like a rag doll.
ANGLE ON DR. PETERS, fifty yards up the concourse, glancing back.
ANGLE ON COLE, pulling his pistol.
ANGLE ON THE SECOND SECURITY OFFICER.
FIRST SECURITY OFFICER
HE'S GOT A GUN!
ANGLE ON THE FIRST DETECTIVE, raising his pistol at COLE.
FIRST DETECTIVE
STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!
ANGLE ON COLE, gun in hand, sprinting along the concourse toward
DR. PETERS as frightened TRAVELERS SCREAM and dive for cover.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, standing at a concourse window, watching a
plane land, flanked by his parents whose faces we don't see.
IT'S SUDDENLY AS IF THE DREAM IS HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE!!! THE
SAME MOKENTS INTERSPERSED WITH ""NEW"" MOMENTS FROM THE POV OF
YOUNG COLE who, hearing the commotion, turns just as DR. PETERS
hurries by. DR. PETERS bumps into YOUNG COLE and reacts by
pulling his Bulls bag close to his body and calling...
DR. PETERS
WATCH IT!
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, wide eyed, watching...
YOUNG COLE'S POV: a BLONDE MAN. dashing up the concourse, his
moustache slipping over his lip, a pistol in his hand.
YOUNG COLE'S POV: the FIRST DETECTIVE aims, looking for a clear
shot in the crowded passageway.
YOUNG COLE'S POV: a BRUNETTE in flashy clothes, gaudy earrings,
high heels, and sun glasses SCREAMS...
BRUNETTE (RAILLY)
N0OOOOO0O!!!!!!
YOUNG COLE'S POV: the FIRST DETECTIVE, firing! CRACK!
YOUNG COLE'S POV: the BLONDE MAN, shuddering, staggering, falling.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, stunned, as his PARENTS try to shield him.
MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
My God! They shot that man!
Mesmerized, YOUNG COLE watches the BRUNETTE rush to the BLONDE
MAN, kneel beside him, minister to his bloody wound.
YOUNG COLE'S POV: the BLONDE MAN, fatalistically reaching up
and tenderly touching the BRUNETTE'S cheek, touching her tears.
(WE'VE SEEN THIS EXACT IMAGE IN COLE'S DREAM, A POWERFUL MOMENT,
UNFOLDING UNNATURALLY SLOWLY, OPENING LIKE A FLOWER.)
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, not able to hear their words, but he can see
emotion as the BLONDE MAN tries to tell the sobbing BRUNETTE something.
YOUNG COLE'S POV: PARAMEDICS, breaking the spell, pushing the
BRUNETTE aside as they crouch beside the BLONDE MAN.
FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
Come along, son, this is no place for us.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, as his FATHER'S ARM drapes over his shoulder,
steering him. YOUNG COLE turns to look back as he's led away.
YOUNG COLE'S POV: the PARAMEDICS, exchanging glances, shrugging
helplessly. It's too late. The BLONDE MAN is dead.
YOUNG COLE sees the BRUNETTE, her face streaked with tears,
suddenly turn and look around, scanning the crowd, searching for
something. POLICE OFFICERS approach her, say something to her.
Even as she responds, her eyes continue to scan the concourse.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, being hurried toward the lobby by his PARENTS
(whose faces remain out of view). He can't help sneaking another
look back.
YOUNG COLE'S POV: POLICE, handcuffing a distracted, unresisting
RAILLY. Even now, she continues to look around almost frantically.
Suddenly, her gaze falls on YOUNG COLE and she reacts...she's
found what she's looking for!
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, reacting to the intensity of her look.
ANGLE ON RAILLY, her eyes speaking to the boy across the crowded
concourse.
ANGLE ON YOUNG COLE, overwhelmed by the look.
FATHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
Hurry up, son.
With a last lingering look toward the mysterious BRUNETTE, YOUNG
COLE turns away, tears welling in his eyes. WE MOVE IN...CLOSE...
CLOSE...CLOSER...on his eyes. WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE TEAR MEANS,
BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS THINKING,
BUT WE KNOW VERY WELL WHAT HE WILL REMEMBER!
MOTHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
Pretend it was just a bad dream, Jimmy.
INT. 747 CABIN - DAY
DR. PETERS closes the door to the overhead luggage rack
containing his Chicago Bulls bag and takes his seat. Next to
him, a FELLOW TRAVELER, unseen, says...
FELLOW TRAVELER'S VOICE (o.s.)
It's obscene, all the violence, all the
lunacy. Shootings even at airports now.
You might say...we're the next endangered
species...human beings!
CLOSE ON DR. PETERS, smiling affably, turning to his neighbor.
DR. PETERS
I think you're right. sir. I think
you've hit the nail on the head.
DR. PETERS' POV: the FELLOW TRAVELER, a silver haired gentleman
in a business suit, offering his hand congenially. DR. PETERS
doesn't know who this man is, but we do. It's the ASTROPHYSICIST!
ASTROPHYSICIST
Jones is my name. I'm in insurance.
EXT. PARKING LOT/AIRPORT
As YOUNG COLE'S PARENTS (seen only as sleeves and torsos) usher
YOUNG COLE into their station wagon, the boy hesitates, looks
back, watches a 747 climb into the sky.

August 2, 1988
Director's Revision
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ABYSS
OMITTED 1
OMITTED 2
TITLE: THE ABYSS -- ON BLACK, DISSOLVING TO COBALT BLUE
EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER -- DAY 3
Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down.
PROPELLER SOUND. Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine.
INT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY 4
In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat
in the glow of their instruments. The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around
BARNES, the sonarman.
CAPTAIN
Sixty knots? No way, Barnes... the reds don't
have anything that fast.
BARNES
Checked it twice, skipper. It's a real unique
signature. No cavitation, no reactor noise...
doesn't even sound like screws.
He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING. The captain studies
the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of
the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an
amorphous trace, representing the bogey.
CAPTAIN
What the hell is it?
EXEC
I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of
ours.
BARNES
Sir! Contact changing heading to two-one-four,
diving. Speed eighty knots! Eighty knots!
EXEC
Eighty knots...
BARNES
Still diving, depth nine hundred feet. Port
clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.
FRANK
(simultaneously)
Still diving, depth nine hundred feet. Port
clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.
Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the
intruder. The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side-
scan sonar array. The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls.
EXEC
(low, to Captain)
It's getting tight in here.
CAPTAIN
We can still give him a haircut. Helm, come
right to oh six niner, down five degrees.
HELMSMAN
Coming right to oh six niner, sir. Down five
degrees.
NAVIGATOR
Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet
narrowing to seventy-five. Sir, we have a
proximity warning light.
EXEC
That's too damn close! We've gotta back off.
BARNES
Range to contact, two hundred. Contact junked to
bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one
hundred thirty knots, sir!
EXEC
(really freaked now)
Nothing goes one thirty!
Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness.
EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA 5
We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes
rapidly under the sub's hull. Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater
sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways.
INT. U.S.S. MONTANA 6
The bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted.
EXEC
Turbulence! We're in its wake!
SIRENS. Everyone shouting at once. The power flickers low.
CAPTAIN
Helm, all stop! Full right rudder!
HELMSMAN
All stop. Full right rudder. Hydraulic failure.
Planes are not responding, sir!
Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan
display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM.
HELMSMAN
Hydraulics restored, sir.
EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA 7
The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slow-motion. The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping
along and bouncing off. One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG!
INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM 8
With the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner
hatches. Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods,
blast into the room. Everything vanishes instantly in white spray.
INT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER 9
Everyone is hurled off his feet. The planesman flights to recover control of
the yoke.
CAPTAIN
Collision alarm! Collision alarm! Lighten
her up, Charlie!
NAVIGATOR
The torpedo room is flooded, sir!
CAPTAIN
Blow all tanks! Blow everything!
HELMSMAN
Passing twelve hundred feet...
EXEC
Blowing main tanks!
HELMSMAN
Twelve hundred fifty feet...
EXT. MONTANA 10
The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section,
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell.
INT. MONTANA CONTROL ROOM 11
The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified.
EXEC
Main forward tanks ruptured!
HELMSMAN
Passing thirteen hundred feet...
EXEC
Too deep to pump auxiliaries!
CAPTAIN
All back full! All back full!
HELMSMAN
Answering all back full. Passing thirteen hundred
fifty feet... fourteen hundred... fourteen
fifty...
The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din...
CAPTAIN
We're losing her. Launch the buoy!
The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button. A red light
comes on. The Captains takes a deep breath.
EXT. MONTANA 12
A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface. A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge, tearing open its pressure hull.
INT. MONTANA 13
VARIOUS QUICK CUTS, just flashes and impressions, as...
Seawater blasts down the corridors --
Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls --
Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds --
Bursts through hatches into the reactor room --
Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second.
EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER 14
In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull
SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur. Descending in an
avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a
blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of
the Cayman Trough. The abyss.
EXT. OCEAN SURFACE -- DAY 15
Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky. The
Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting.
CUT TO:
EXT. OCEAN/20 MILES AWAY -- DAY 16
LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight
at us, FILLING FRAME.
REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.
The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen. A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum ""company man"" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander.
INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/BRIDGE -- DAY 17
The bridge is state-of-the-art, with computers and sophisticated navigation
and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video
monitors. The Drilling Operations Supervisor, LELAND MCBRIDE, and BENDIX,
the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below.
MCBRIDE
Does not look good at all.
TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN (MINUTES LATER) showing divers working in total
blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean. They
move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion, looking like
space-suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses.
DEMARCO (V.O.)
No light from the surface. How deep are they?
MCBRIDE (V.O.)
Seventeen hundred feet.
WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room. DeMarco is
hardcore military, brusque and efficient. Kirkhill is a small man with
pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means
company man and/or dickhead.
DEMARCO
I need them to go to over two thousand.
KIRKHILL
They can do it.
(to McBride)
Get Brigman on the line.
CUT TO:
EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY (TOTAL DARKNESS) 18
1700 FEET BELOW. A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island
of light in the vast blackness. Its main framework connects two ""tri-
modules"" consisting of three cylinders each. These contain living and work
areas in a pressurized environment. An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface. In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
""toolpusher,"" BUD BRIGMAN. He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER.
BUD
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
CATFISH
(Kentucky drawl)
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out
here sooo much, boss.
OMITTED 19
INT. DRILL ROOM 20
Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor. The working heart of
the rig. THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR. The drill crew, in hardhats and mud-
plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the
chamber. The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate. The
others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY
DIETZ. Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive
roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest.
JAMMER
(yelling)
Bud! Hippy's on the bitch-box. It's a call
from topside. That new company man.
BUD
Kirkhill? That guy doesn't know his butt from
a rathole. Hey, Perry!
One of the roustabouts, a wiry Texan, turns to him.
BUD
Do me a favor and square away the mud hose and
those cable slings. This place is starting to
look like my apartment.
Perry chuckles and sets to the task cheerfully. Bud EXITS, ducking his head
through a low watertight hatch.
INT. CORRIDOR/TOOLPUSHER'S OFFICE 21
Bud tromps down the narrow corridor, his work boots gonging on steel.
P.A. (HIPPY'S VOICE)
BUD, PICK UP THE TOPSIDE LINE URGENT.
BUD
I'm coming. Keep your pantyhose on.
He enters his office, a tiny cubicle with stacks of paperwork, dust-
gathering tech manuals and waterstained Penthouse fold-outs. He picks up the
phone... punches down a line.
BUD
Brigman here. Kirkhill? What's going on?
(pause)
I am calm. I'm a calm person. Is there some
reason why I shouldn't be calm?
HOLD ON Bud's expression, darkening, as he listens.
INT. CORRIDOR/CONTROL MODULE 22
The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago,
packed with instrumentation. At the end is a small bay with multiple
viewports. Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver
can be seen welding. He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and
by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK. Little Geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER.
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little
machine. The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee. His pet white rat,
BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders. The door BANGS OPEN.
Hippy jumps, slops his coffee. Bud strides in. Not calm.
BUD
Son of a bitch.
He kicks a chair out of the way and slams his palm down on a switch marked
DIVER RECALL. A SIREN, blasting through the water from a big hydrophone
loudspeaker.
BUD
All divers. Drop what you're doing. Everybody
out of the pool.
EXT. DEEPCORE/CHRISTMAS TREE A22
Flatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a
bubble canopy. She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business. She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work. Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter. One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the
pipe.
ONE NIGHT
Here you go, hon'.
SONNY
Just in time, sugar.
They react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module.
ONE NIGHT
Dammit, we just got out here.
SONNY
There was a time when I would have asked why.
One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he
narrowly avoids.
CUT TO:
EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER SUB-BAY 23
Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny
riding on its top deck. It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the
surface of the water in the chamber above. Little Geek follows like an
obedient dog.
INT. SUB-BAY/MOONPOOL 24
The opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched
through it. From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool.
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it. The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a
similar submersible. Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys
are helping the divers out of the water. The water at this depth is only
about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune-
fingered. Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish
face.
FINLER
What's goin' on? How come we got recalled?
SONNY
Hell is I know.
One Night jumps 'ashore' from Flatbed's broad deck and joins them. Catfish
is unzipping his bulky dry-suit.
CATFISH
Just follow standard procedure, will ya...
flog the dog till somebody tells us what's
happening.
JAMMER
Hey, Catfish, I'll sell you my October Penthouse
for twenty bucks.
ONE NIGHT
Save you money, darlin'... the pages are all
stuck together by now.
Bud enters, approaching the group.
JAMMER
What's goin' on, Boss?
BUD
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole
and prepare to move the rig.
SONNY
She-hit.
BUD
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of
national security. Now you know exactly as much
as I do. So just get your gear off and get up to
control. There's some kind of briefing in ten
minutes.
CUT TO:
INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE 25
The whole rig crew is somehow jammed into the room for the video briefing.
DeMarco is on the main monitor, with his aides and Kirkhill visible b.g.
DEMARCO
At 09:22 local time this morning, an American
nuclear submarine, the USS Montana, with 156 men
aboard, went down 22 miles from here. There has
been no contact with the sub since then. The
cause of the incident is not known.
PAN AROUND the reactions of the various drill crew members... shocked,
hushed, curious.
DEMARCO
Your company has authorized the Navy's use of
this facility for a rescue operation. The code
name is Operation Salvor.
ONE NIGHT
You want us to search for the sub?
DEMARCO
No. We know where it is. But she's in 2000 feet
of water and we can't reach her. We need divers
to enter the sub and search for survivors, if
any.
Bud's scowl has been deepening since DeMarco started to talk.
BUD
Don't you guys have your own stuff for this type
of thing?
DEMARCO
By the time we get our rescue submersible here
the storm front will be right on us. But you
can get your rig in under the storm and be on-
site in fifteen hours. That makes you our best
option right now.
Hippy, born suspicious and recently graduated to paranoid, leans forward...
HIPPY
Why should we risk our butts on a job like this?
KIRKHILL
I have been authorized to offer you all special-
duty bonuses equivalent to three times normal
dive pay.
CATFISH
Hell, for triple time I'd crawl through razor
blades and shower off with lime juice.
FINLER
I'm here to tell ya', you could set me on fire
and call me names.
BUD
Look, I don't know what kind of a deal you guys
worked out with the company, but my people are
not qualified for this... they're oil workers.
DEMARCO
A four-man SEAL team will transfer down to you
to supervise the operation.
BUD
You can send down whoever you like, but I'm the
toolpusher on this rig, and when it comes to the
safety of these people, there's me... then
there's God. Understand? If things get dicey,
I'm pulling the plug.
KIRKHILL
I think we're all on the same wavelength,
Brigman. Now let's get the wellhead uncoupled,
shall we?
CUT TO:
INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE AND CORRIDOR 26
Bud stands beside the hatchway as the others file out toward their tasks.
They comment gravely as they pass...
JAMMER
When Lindsey finds out about this, it's not
gonna be a pretty sight.
ONE NIGHT
They're going to have to shoot her with a
tranquilizer gun.
CUT TO:
EXT. OCEAN -- DAY 27
A single Navy Sea King churns through the rain under massive thunderheads.
The sea below is whipped by the storm.
INT./EXT. SEA KING 28
PANNING ALONG BOOTED FEET, four pairs of black military size twelves line
up, onto... a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles.
WIDER, revealing the four-man team of Navy SEALs. And a slender woman in
her early thirties. She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed
conservatively in a skirt and jacket. Meet LINDSEY. Project Engineer for
Deepcore. She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her. Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm. The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues. They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types. The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes
his way forward to the cockpit.
The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a
helicopter in position. Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic
Explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea.
PILOT
No way I'm putting her down. I shouldn't even
be flying in this shit.
COFFEY
(cool)
Just hold it over the deck.
Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft. He
nods to the others SEALs, MONK, WILHITE, and SCHOENICK. In the open side
door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the
coil. One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out.
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping
to the deck. One, two, three. Coffey looks at her.
COFFEY
You want to be on that ship, there's only one
way it's going to happen.
He's sure she won't go for it. It's his certainty that gets her. She sets
her jaw. Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her
shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth. Then grabs
the rope and slides down.
EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER/HELIPAD 29
Swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum, Lindsey fast-ropes forty
feet to the deck. She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her.
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides. Her nylons are
ruined. An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases
using the rescue sling. The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across
the deck. They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the
mounting storm.
CUT TO:
EXT. OCEAN BOTTOM 30
BLACKNESS. Then shafts of light become visible, above a ridge of rock.
Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables. Behind it, the mass of
Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing.
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern
thrusters.
INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE 31
Bud, his feet propped up, uses joystick controls to 'fly' Deepcore,
maneuvering against currents and around seafloor obstacles. He is guided
by the side-scan sonar display, with Hippy assisting in the sonar shack.
Through the front viewport, Flatbed can be seen out ahead.
McBride appears on the bridge monitor, holding a sheet of weather-fax.
MCBRIDE (on screen)
Well, it's official, sportsfans. They're calling
it Hurricane Frederick, and it's going to be
making our lives real interesting in a few hours.
INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY 32
Bud responds via video.
BUD
Fred, huh? I don't know. Hurricanes should be
named after women.
McBride looks up as the bridge door opens. Lindsey enters in a blast of wind,
wet as a wharf rat and twice as pissed off. Maybe Bud is right.
CUT TO:
INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE 33
Bud is surprised to see Lindsey's face appear on the monitor screen.
LINDSEY
I can't believe you let them do this!
BUD
(unpreturbed, almost cheerful)
Hi, Lins. I thought you were in Houston.
LINDSEY
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last
flight out here. Only here isn't where I left
it, is it, Bud?
BUD
Wasn't up to me.
LINDSEY
We were that close to proving a submersible
drilling platform could work. We had over seven
thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake. I
can't believe you let them grab my rig!
BUD
Your rig?
LINDSEY
My rig. I designed the damn thing.
BUD
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it. So as long
as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they
tell me.
LINDSEY
You wimp. I had a lot riding on this. They
bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
BUD
I'm switching off now.
LINDSEY
Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand up
to fight. You--
Bud hits the switch and the screen goes dead.
BUD
Bye.
Hippy looks over him, trying very hard not to crack up.
HIPPY
Virgil?
BUD
God, I hate that bitch.
HIPPY
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Bud nods fatalistically.
CUT TO:
EXT. EXPLORER DECK/LAUNCH WELL 34
Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray.
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE,
eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible. It slams violently in its steel
cradle as the drill-ship rolls. Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in
to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible.
Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall.
She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs,
lying on the deck. Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up.
LINDSEY
Let's go, gentlemen! We either launch now or
we don't launch.
Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and
grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man.
LINDSEY
Take her up, Byron!
Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and
starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches. The submersible is then
swung out to the center of the launch well. It sways and gyrates above the
furious water below. Lindsey drops into the upper hatch.
INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C. 35
Kirkhill leans suddenly over the console to look out the window.
KIRKHILL
What the hell is she doing out there? Son of a
bitch...
(into microphone)
Lindsey... get out of Cab Three. Bates is taking
her down.
INT. CAB THREE 36
Lindsey pulls her headset as she dogs down the inside locking levers of the
hatch.
LINDSEY
Bates is sick. Besides I've got more hours in
this thing than he does.
(to Coffey)
A little change of plan.
The little sub is swinging like a pendulum on the cable, and the SEALs,
jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into
the walls. Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks.
COFFEY
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
LINDSEY
Just hold your water, okay?
(to Kirkhill)
So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk
about it?
INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE/D.O.C. 37
The plug is pulled on DeMarco's patience.
DEMARCO
I don't care who drives the damn thing. Just get
my team in the water.
KIRKHILL
Alright, alright. Christ Almighty!
He gestured dismissively to McBride.
MCBRIDE
Cab Three, you are clear to launch.
INT./EXT. CAB THREE 38
Lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever.
LINDSEY
Roger.
(to Coffey)
There's only one way it's going to happen...
She pulls the lever hard. CLUNK-CLANG! The shackle-release drops the sub.
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right
on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks. Coffey et al have been slammed
hard.
LINDSEY
Touchdown. The crowd goes wild. Explorer...
Cab Three. We are styling.
MCBRIDE (filtered)
Roger, Cab Three.
Lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so
that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port. Moving up
through her lights, it will guide her down to the rig. Cab Three free-falls
into increasing darkness. Soon it is a candle below us in the indigo.
EXT./INT. FLATBED 39
One Night is driving the tug one-handed, pouring coffee from a thermos and
rocking out to the great truck-driving song ""Willing"" on the beat-box she's
got propped up on the sonar rig. Fighting white-line fever in the best
tradition.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 40
Bud and Hippy come in for a rousing chorus.
BUD/HIPPY
... I've been driving every kinda rig that's
ever been maaaaade...
EXT. DEEPCORE 41
Lit up like a proud Peterbilt, the rig crossed the trackless wastes. We
hear them singing, carried OVER.
EXT. OCEAN DEPTHS/CAB THREE 42
In total blackness, the submersible descends along the rigorous line of the
umbilical cable. Two hundred feet below it, the lights of Deepcore resolve
out of the darkness. Now we can see the rig crawling over the ocean bottom
like some monster lawnmower.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on
final approach.
HIPPY (V.O.)
Gotcha, Cab Three. Who is that? That You,
Lindsey?
INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE 43
Bud stop singing and snaps around at the mention of her name.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
None other.
Bud's expression is nothing less than stricken.
BUD
Oh no... you gotta be kidding me.
EXT./CAB THREE/DEEP CORE 44
Lindsey executes a 180 degree turn and cruises over the control module, back
through the A-frame toward the docking hatch. The flange of Cab Three's
lockout hatch settles over the pressure collar on the rig's back. There is
a CLUNK as it mates up.
INT. DEEPCORE/COMPRESSION CHAMBER/GAS CONTROL STATION 45
Lindsey drops down from the hatch into the small cylindrical pressure chamber.
The SEALs drop down behind her, passing their gear through hand-over-hand.
The chamber is spartan, with steel benches, a folding card table, breathing
masks, and medical supplies. Catfish greets them through the tiny porthole
at one end.
CATFISH
Howdy, y'all. Hey, Lindsey! I'll be damned!
You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll
might run ya stockings.
LINDSEY
Couldn't stay away. You running mixture for us?
Good. Couldn't ask for better.
CATFISH
Okay, here we go. Start equalizing, y'all.
HISSSS of inrushing compressed gas. The pressure in the chamber rises. The
breathing mixture is composed of helium, oxygen and nitrogen. Catfish
monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber, watching the
gauges with a practiced eye. Lindsey and the SEALs all grab their noses
and start making funny faces... popping their ears with the familiar diver's
'equalization' technique. They continue as:
LINDSEY
Get comfortable. The bad news is we got six
hours in this can, blowing down. The worse news
is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress
back to the surface later.
COFFEY
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
LINDSEY
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that. Alright,
from now on we watch each other closely for
signs of HPNS...
MONK
(as if by rote)
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome. Muscle tremors,
usually in the hands first. Nausea, increased
excitability, disorientation.
LINDSEY
Very good. About one person in twenty just can't
handle it. They go buggo. They're no way to
predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
COFFEY
Look, we've all made chamber runs to this depth.
We're checked out.
LINDSEY
Oh... chamber runs. Uh huh, that's good.
(Coffey turn away)
Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
They ignore her. Start going over some diagrams of the Montana's interior.
It's going to be a long six hours.
INT. GAS CONTROL STATION -- HOURS LATER 46
Catfish checks his watch, then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri-
mix manifold, watching the gauges. Satisfied, he leans over to the pressure
window in the door, checking out the SEALs. Hippy has come down from the
control deck for an advanced look are the interlopers. Jammer is in a chair,
reading a Louis L'Amour paperback.
CATFISH
Those guys ain't so tough. I fought plenty of
guys tougher'n them.
HIPPY
Now we get to hear about how he used to be a
contender.
Catfish hold up one calloused fist up in front of Hippy's face.
CATFISH
You see this? They used to call this the Hammer.
JAMMER
Hippy wasn't born then.
INT. PRESSURE CHAMBER 47
It looks like the end of a long bus trip. Everyone silent... leafing
through beat-to-hell magazines or just staring. Lindsey has her feet propped
up on the smaller of the SEALs' two equipment cases. She casually toes open
one of the latches, then the other. Glances at Coffey. He's reading. She
begins to lift the lid with her toe. Gets a GLIMPSE INSIDE, of packing foam,
and what looks like a SMALL BLACK METAL BOX. Then... WHAM! Coffey's foot
comes down on the lid, slamming it shut. Startled, she looks up into his
cool gaze.
COFFEY
Curiosity killed the cat.
CUT TO:
INT. GAS CONTROL STATION/CHAMBER DOOR -- LATER 48
TIGHT ON CATFISH'S hands... closing values... spinning the wheel on the
chamber hatch. CUT WIDER as it cracks open with a virgin's sigh and swings
aside.
CATFISH
Y'all'er done to a turn and ready to serve.
Everybody okay?
The SEALs nod peremptorily and shoulder their gear. Lindsey exists first,
followed by Monk, Wilhite, and Schoenick. Coffey bends to relatch the small
equipment case. He is alone for one moment in the chamber. He raises his
hand and stares at it. The fingertips are trembling the slightest bit. He
clenches them into a fist and walks out.
INT. CORRIDOR 49
As Lindsey emerges into the main corridor of the rig, she bumps into a large,
dark mass.
LINDSEY
Hey, was there a wall here before? I don't
remember a wall here. Oh, Jammer! Hi.
The 'wall' grins down to her.
JAMMER
Howdy, there, little lady.
Coffey emerges behind them and, ignoring Lindsey, faces Jammer.
COFFEY
(to Jammer)
Show us the dive prep area. We need to check
out your gear.
Jammer scowls, turns and leads the SEALs in the sub-bay. Catfish and Lindsey
exchange a look.
LINDSEY
Those guys are about a much fun as a tax audit.
CUT TO:
INT. COMMAND MODULE 50
TIGHT ON HIPPY, bathed in the light of the sonar display. He is making
kissing sounds at Beany, who has his inquisitive nose right up to Hippy's
lips.
LINDSEY
Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease.
WIDER, as Hippy and Bud to see Lindsey leaning in the doorway. She and Bud
size each other up. He opts for a jovial approach, his eyes wary.
BUD
Well, well. Mrs. Brigman.
LINDSEY
Not for long.
Lindsey crossed past him, her eyes scanning the banks of equipment, almost
unconsciously checking, checking... getting the pulse of her big iron baby.
BUD
You never did like being called that, did you?
LINDSEY
Not even when it meant something.
(looking through the front port)
Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
BUD
Who else?
Lindsey leans past Bud to the gooseneck mike on the console.
LINSEY
Hi, One Night, it's Lindsey.
INT. FLATBED 51
One Night mimes a puking motion, finger down her throat. Then she replies
with sickening sweetness...
ONE NIGHT
Oh, hi, Lindsey.
INT. COMMAND MODULE 52
Lindsey fives the sonar shack the once-over. She tweaks some knobs.
BUD
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come
down. Now you're stuck here for the storm...
dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
LINDSEY
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
She crosses past Bud and exits into the corridor. Bud bolts out of the chair
to follow her and Hippy scrambles in to take over.
INT. CORRIDOR/LADDER-WELL/LEVEL ONE LANDING 53
Bud catches up with Lindsey in the corridor, and through the following keeps
pace with here as she make here inspection.
BUD
Then why'd you come down?
She stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe. He almost slams into her. She
moves on, climbing down the ladder to the lower level.
LINDSEY
You need me. Nobody knows the systems on this
rig better than I do. What is something was
to go wrong after the Explorer clears off? What
would have you done?
BUD
Wow, you're right! Us poor dumb ol' boys might've
had to think for ourselves. Coulda been a
disaster.
On the lower level landing, Lindsey opens a hatch into one of the machine
rooms. ROAR OF PUMPS AND COMPRESSORS.
INT. MACHINE ROOM 54
Lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and
roaring machinery. Her eyes rove constantly over fittings, gauges, circuit
panels.
BUD
(yelling)
You wanna know what I think?
LINDSEY
Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set!
Morons.
She scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely.
BUD
I think you were worried about me.
LINDSEY
That must be it.
Lindsey's on the move again, and Bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up.
BUD
No, I think you were. Come on, admit it.
LINDSEY
I was worried about the rig. I've got over four
years invested in this project.
BUD
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years
with me.
She looks up at him.
LINDSEY
You've got to have priorities.
CUT TO:
INT. BUD'S ROOM 55
Darkness. The door opens and Bud snaps on the light.
BUD
My bunk's the only one I can guarantee won't be
occupied. You can grab a couple hours before
we get there.
Lindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room, the only private bunk on the
rig. Rank had its privileges. His hand on the door is just level with her
eyes. She notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium
(something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from
M.I.T.).
LINDSEY
What are you still wearing that for?
BUD
I don't know. Divorce ain't final. Forgot to
take it off.
Bud stays in the doorway. Lindsey takes a heaps of Bud's cloths off the
narrow bunk. Start unconsciously straightening the room.
LINDSEY
I haven't worn mine in months.
BUD
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it. The
Suit.
LINDSEY
Do you always have to call him that? The Suit?
It makes you sound like such a hick. His name
is Michael.
Lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks.
Bud eyes her, sounding too causal.
BUD
So what about ""Michael"" then... Mr. Brooks
Brothers... Mr. BMW. You still seeing him?
LINDSEY
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
BUD
What happened?
LINDSEY
Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of
you life any more.
BUD
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one
day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
LINDSEY
You're right, Bud. It was just that simple.
Aren't you clever? You should get your own
show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn
from three hundred fathoms.
She closes the watertight door, forcing him out. Locks it. She turns and
throws her shoe hard against the far wall.
LINDSEY
AAAARRRGGH!
She flops down on the bed, sitting... staring at the wall. Her armor is
gone. She looks small and vulnerable. A long beat. She reaches over to the
tiny sink. Amid the clutter is a bottle of Bud's aftershave. She unscrews
it and takes a sniff. Catches herself. Tosses it.
LINDSEY
Shit.
INT. QUARTERS/HEAD 56
Bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger. He pulls
the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet. He reaches forward to
flush. Can't do it. Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the
toilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring.
He puts it on and washes his hands. The right hand stays faintly blue no
matter how hard he scrubs.
BUD
Shit.
CUT TO:
EXT. DEEPCORE 57
The platform is stopped, hovering in place. Like a great spacecraft setting
down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze. Flatbed
releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside.
CUT TO:
INT. SUB-BAY 58
CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH, actually a computer-composited down-looking scan from
a towed LIDAR (laser imaging sonar) rig. It shows a faint, blurry outline of
the Montana lying on her side on a ledge part-way down the canyon wall. There
is no detail. A finger points to a flat ledge nearby. An ""X"" has been put
on with a grease pencil.
COFFEY (V.O.)
This is us. We're just on the edge of the Cayman
Trough. The Montana is here, on its side, 300
meters away and 70 meters below us. We think she
slid down the wall, and lodged against this
outcropping.
CUT WIDE, showing the rig crew gathered around a worktable in the sub-bay.
The divers, Bud, Catfish, Sonny, Finler, Jammer, and the four SEALs have
their dry-suits on. The pre-dive briefing. Lindsey, One Night, and Hippy
will crew the submersibles. Wilhite is going around clipping DOSIMETER
BADGES on everybody.
SONNY
This tells us how much radiation we get?
HIPPY
Hey, whoah... I can't handle no radiation, man.
Forget it! Include me out.
CATFISH
Hippy, you pussy.
HIPPY
What good's the money if your dick drops off in
six months?
COFFEY
We'll take reading as we go. If the reactor's
breached or the warheads have released
radioactive debris, we'll back away. Simple.
BUD
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you
can run Little Geek.
Bud pats the top of a small ROV, sitting next to its larger brother, Big
Geek.
HIPPY
No way! No way! He can't fly an ROV worth
shit. I'll go. Shit!
COFFEY
(to all)
On the dive, you will do absolutely nothing
without direct orders from me, and you will
follow my instructions without discussion. Is
this clear? Alright, I want everyone finished
prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.
The rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear. Some are studying
the diagrams of the Montana's interior layout. Bud takes Coffey aside as
the others prepare.
BUD
Look, it's three AM. These guys are running on
bad coffee and four hours sleep. You better
start cutting them some slack.
COFFEY
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
BUD
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me,
you start ordering my guys around. It won't
work. You gotta know how to handle these
people... we have a certain way of doing things
here.
COFFEY
I'm not interested in your way of doing things.
Just get your team ready to dive.
End of discussion. Coffey is walking away. Burning, Bud crosses to his gear
locker. Picks up his helmet. Finler is suiting out next to him.
FINLER
Hey, you know your hand is blue?
BUD
Shut up and get your gear on.
NEARBY, Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable. Hippy
points to the heavy equipment case that says F.B.S. DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
HIPPY
I've been meaning to ask you what this thing is.
Mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like
a space helmet, and a large backpack.
MONK
Fluid breathing system. We just got them. We
use it if we need to go really deep.
HIPPY
How deep?
MONK
Deep.
(shrugs)
It's classified... you know. Anyway, you
breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed.
Pressure doesn't get to you.
Catfish is grappling with the concept.
CATFISH
You're saying you get liquid in your lungs?
MONK
Oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion.
Monk take a clear plastic box full of O-rings off the shelf and dumps them
out. He opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside
it to drain into the box. Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippy's
shoulder.
HIPPY
Hey!
MONK
Check this out.
He drops Beany in the box and, before Hippy can protest, closes the lid.
Beany is forced under the surface. He struggled for a second, and bubbles
come out of his mouth. Then he casually swims around in there, completely
submerged... breathing liquid. Catfish and the others stare into the box,
amazed.
MONK
See? He's diggin' it.
Monk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his
lungs. Then hands him back to Hippy. The rat is annoyed, but otherwise
alright.
CATFISH
This is no bullshit hands down the goddamnedest
thing I ever saw.
CUT TO:
EXT. DEEPCORE/DROPOFF 59
Three sets of moving lights move outward from Deepcore. Cab One and Three,
with Lindsey and Hippy at the controls respectively, and One Night in the
Flatbed. Lindsey is in the lead. She approaches the cliff-like drop-off
and starts to descend.
LINDSEY
Com-check, everybody. Flatbed, you on line?
ONE NIGHT
Ten-four, Lindsey, read you loud and clear.
LINDSEY
Cab Three?
HIPPY
Cab Three, check. Right behind you.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
What's you depth, Cab Three?
HIPPY
1840... 50... 60... 70...
LINDSEY
Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065.
Everybody stay tight and in sight.
ONE NIGHT
Starting out descent. Divers, how're you doing?
EXT. FLATBED 60
Eight divers ride the back of Flatbed like itinerant workers on the way to
the fields. Bud and his civilian crew, Catfish, Finler, and Jammer... sit
across from the SEALs. They are in their gear and breathing from umbilical
hooked in Flatbed's low-pressure manifold.
BUD
Okay so far.
JAMMER
How deep's the drop-off here?
CATFISH
This here's the bottomless pit, baby. Two and
a half miles straight down.
COFFEY
Knock off the chatter. Cab One, you getting
anything?
INT./EXT. CAB ONE 61
Lindsey consults her array of instruments.
COFFEY
Cab One, do you see it yet?
LINDSEY
The magnetometer is pegged. Side-scan is showing
a big return, but I don't see anything yet. Are
you sure you got the depth right on this?
BUD (V.O., filtered)
You should be almost to it, ace.
She turns the submersible and...
The spotlight flares back from the great brass screw of the Montana. It
dwarfs Cab One, FILLING FRAME.
LINDSEY
Uh, yeah, roger that... uh, found it.
EXT. MONTANA/SUBMERSIBLES 62
Cab One maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub, while Flatbed and Cab
Three move above it. Wilhite take readings with a hand-held neutron counter.
COFFEY
Cab One, radiation readings?
LINDSEY
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
COFFEY
Wilhite, anything?
WILHITE
Negative. Nominal.
COFFEY
Just continue forward along the hull.
LINDSEY
Copy that, continuing forward. You just want
me to get shots of everything, right?
COFFEY
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep
moving. We're on a tight timeline.
LINDSEY
Copy that.
The great black hull of the Montana recedes into the darkness beyond the
puny beams of their lights. It seems bigger than the Titanic and just as
eerie in its final resting place. On it side, the sub's top deck becomes a
wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving. Ahead, in the lights, is
a white painted circle.
COFFEY
That's the midship hatch. You see it, Cab Three?
HIPPY
Roger, I see it.
BUD
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
HIPPY
Check. Then I just hang with these guys, right?
COFFEY
Right.
ONE NIGHT
How do you want me?
COFFEY
Just hold above it. Alright, A team.
Wilhite, Schoenick, and Monk unhook their short whip-umbilicals from the
central manifold and roll off the side of Flatbed. They maneuver down toward
the sub's hatch. Hippy guides Cab Three in closer to the hatch area.
INT. CAB THREE 63
Hippy turns to Perry back in the lockout chamber, ready to launch Little Geek.
The ROV has a handheld neutron-counter gripped in its manipulator arm.
MONK (V.O.)
Stand by on the ROV.
HIPPY
Perry, stand by on the ROV.
(to Little Geek)
Sorry about this, little buddy. Better you than
me, know what I mean?
Hippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and
feed out a length of tether. Hippy picks up the control box and watches the
video screen, guiding the ROV toward the Montana's hatch.
EXT. MONTANA HATCH AREA 64
The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch. They
open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk. He bangs
on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed
against it.
MONK
It's flooded. Alright, I'm opening her up.
Straining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims
backs out immediately. He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and
Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch.
EXT./INT. CAB ONE/MISSLE DECK 65
Meanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull. Beyond
Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll
toward us in procession. Several of the hatch covers have been forced
partway open by the warping of the hull.
COFFEY (V.O.)
Radiation is nominal. The warheads must still
be intact.
LINDSEY
How many are there?
COFFEY (V.O.)
24 Trident missiles. Eight MIRVs per missile.
LINDSEY
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are
they?
SCHOENICK
Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons
nominal yield. Say times time Hiroshima.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a
can.
COFFEY (V.O.)
Let's knock off the chatter, please.
INT. CAB THREE 66
TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN -- LITTLE GEEK'S CAMERA. Passing through a hatch, into
a large grotto filled with pipes and machinery. The engine room.
MONK (V.O.)
Getting a reading?
HIPPY
It's twitching but it's below the line you said
was safe.
EXT. MONTANA MIDSHIP HATCH 67
Monk moves into the opening.
MONK
Alright. Let's get in there.
Wilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark
corridor beyond.
EXT. MONTANA/BOW SECTION 68
Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a
five-story building. Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the
ledge which supports the vast sub. Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal
the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail. The torn
and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down.
Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away
from the rest of the hull.
COFFEY
We'll go in through that large breach.
BUD
Let's go, guys.
Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward. The opening is a black mouth in
their lights. Coffey moves inside. Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon
line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him.
BUD
Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in
sight. Watch for hatches that could close on
you, or any loose equipment that could fall.
Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside.
INT. MONTANA/FORWARD BERTHING SECTION 69
They find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of
bunks. The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the
bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs. Papers float in gentle
eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends.
Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward. As they pass sealed doors,
Coffey pounds with a tool, listening. All flooded.
INT. ENGINE ROOM 70
Monk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether. Through
a hatch into the engine room. Their lights play over flooded machinery.
INT. COMPANIONWAY/CONTROL ROOM AND ATTACK CENTER 71
From the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack
center. He pulls at a buckled watertight door.
COFFEY
It's jammed. Give me a hand.
Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey. Together they wrench the door open
on its squealing hinges. It give way suddenly, flying open. The suction
pulls SOMETHING THROUGH. It slams Bud's shoulder. He turns. A FACE...
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM! He jerks back, gasping.
Face to face with Barnes, the sonarman. The ensign seems unmarked, merely
dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth. Coffey
reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way.
COFFEY
Alright, let's keep moving. We knew we were
going to see this.
They enter the control room. Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage.
Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl
in the currents. A languid, weightless waltz. They move through the carnage.
Their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair,
someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down. Dead faces, pale in the
lights. Still. We see only glimpses.
Coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over. Removes the missile
arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck. Moves on. All
business. Bud turns back to his guys. Checking them. He notices Jammer is
breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet. Catfish, Finler, and Sonny
aren't much better. A wave a panic seems imminent.
BUD
How you guys doing?
SONNY
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
CATFISH
Triple time sounds like a lotta money, Bud. It
ain't. I'm sorry...
BUD
We're here now. Let's get her done.
We see Bud working, calming them, talking them through it. He's sweating
rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady. His projection of calm to the
others is his own salvation.
Coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room.
COFFEY
This part I do alone. Brigman, take you men and
continue aft. Split up into two teams of two.
Let's get moving... we head back in fourteen
minutes.
Bud leads his team into a narrow corridor.
INT. CORRIDOR/ROOMS 72
They search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to
a vertical hatch, open. a pit of darkness below.
BUD
Okay, Cat, Lew, Sonny. You guys stay on this
deck. Hook you line onto mine. Any problem,
you tug my line. Two pulls. Jammer, you're
with me.
Bud drops down through the hatch to the level below, followed by Jammer, who
barely fits through. Catfish hooks his safety line onto Bud's with a
carabiner and move along the corridor with the others.
EXT./INT. CAB ONE 73
Lindsey circles the hull, documenting, photographing. Her strobes sear the
darkness, give glimpses of the dead leviathan's form as her tiny submersible
circles it like a bee.
INT. COMMUNICATIONS CENTER 74
Working from a plastic card, Coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens
it. He removes several plastic binders... the code books. He also grabs
handfuls of classified documents and orders, and a set of missile arming keys,
all which he places in a pouch at his waist.
INT. CORRIDOR 75
Bud leads Jammer through a long, claustrophobically narrow corridor, tapping
on the walls and hatches periodically. After he taps, he waits a few
moments. There are no answering taps. They open doors and shine their lights
into the rooms. The are bodies, but they seem anonymous. Crumpled shapes
in khaki or blue. They undog and open a hatch. Beyond it is the largest
chamber of the sub, the...
INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT 76
The missile compartment is the large gallery a hundred and twenty feet long
and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all. The
chamber is divided into three levels by a floor of open steel grillwork.
JAMMER
Where are we?
BUD
Missile compartment. Those are the launch tubes.
They sweep their lights around the chamber. Jammer turns... his beam
illuminating a body just beyond the door. A coveralled seaman turning
slowly in the eddying current. Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the
man's face. One scuttles out of his gaping mouth.
JAMMER
Lord Almighty.
BUD
Hey, you okay?
Bud goes to him. Gets up close to his face. Sees that he's not. That he's
hyperventilating. Fighting nausea. Bud grabs him by the shoulders.
BUD
Deep and slow, big guy. Deep and slow. Just
breathe easy.
JAMMER
I... they're all dead, Bud. They're all dead.
I thought... some of them... you know...
BUD
I'm taking you back out.
JAMMER
No! I'm okay now. I just don't... I can't go
any further in.
Bud sees that the big diver's breathing has stabilized. He looks at his
watch. Checker Jammer's pressure gauges.
BUD
Okay, Jammer. No problem. You stay right here.
I have to go there to the end... you'll see my
lights. We'll stay in voice contact. Just hold
onto the rope. Five more minutes. Okay?
JAMMER
Yeah, okay. Okay.
He moves off through the center aisle of the gallery swimming between the huge
cylinders. He pays out the lifeline as he goes.
INT. COM-ROOM 77
Coffey is working rapidly and efficiently, moving from one rack of electronics
gear to the next, setting thermite grenades at vital points. As the thermite
ignites, it generates an intense arc-bright light and tremendous heat. The
circuit chasses melt. Coffey works calmly in the infernal glare.
INT. MISSLE COMPARTMENT 78
Bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the
missile compartment. He goes down a stairwell to the lower level. A HUNDRED
FEET AWAY, Jammer loses sight of Bud's dive-lights. He starts to get
nervous. Suddenly his own lights begin to DIM, flickering lower and lower.
They become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing. The darkness
closes in.
JAMMER
Bud? BUD?! You readin' me? BUD?!!
BUD, at the same moment, is fiddling with the connector cables on his helmet
lights, which are dimming and flickering. He hears nothing from his helmet
transceiver.
JAMMER, smacks the side of his helmet. Shakes the transceiver on his belt.
Nothing... just static. Then even the static dies. Panic time.
He grabs the safety line and pulls twice. Hard. It is snagged on a sharp
metal edge ten feet from him. He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the
thing. The line severs. Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward
him. His eyes bug. He looks all around in the darkness. Can't see Bud.
Can't decide what to do. We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a
flywheel.
Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls. It is a
cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights.
It grows brighter. He turns slowly toward it.
The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of
cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him.
JAMMER
Bud? Is that you?
C.U. JAMMER, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source.
Guess what, Jammer? It's not Bud. In the brightest center of the glow,
SOMETHING is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls.
Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright
astonishment melting into terror.
The glare pulses subtly, hypnotically. The shifting shadow falls across
Jammer. He finally snaps out of his fixity...
Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand
through the treacherous wreckage.
His harness catches on a twisted pipe.
He struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic.
Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength.
He tears free of the entangling debris. Launches like a torpedo... slamming
his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway. His tri-mix
regulator takes the full brunt of the impact.
ON BUD, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position. The strange
radiance is gone. His dive light flare back to full brightness.
BUD
Jammer? Answer me, buddy, JAMMER?!
He reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place. A seizure.
Bud grapples with him.
BUD
Hang on, big guy. Hand on!
Catfish, Sonny, and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment later. They
leap into the fray.
BUD
He's convulsing!
CATFISH
It's his mixture! Too much oxygen!
Then they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with
the valves on his breathing gear.
FINLER
Crank it down, man! We're gonna losing him...
BUD
SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit!
SONNY
You got it?! You got it?
BUD
Yeah, yeah... yeah. It's turning.
Jammer's convulsion ends. He goes limp.
BUD
We gotta get him out of here. Come on!
(to Jammer)
Hang on, buddy.
They drag Jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly
back along the lifeline.
INT./EXT. CAB ONE & MONTANA SAIL 79
Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the
horizontal diving plane. Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose
power.
Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING
appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of
hell right at her! It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get
a glimpse. What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid,
open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some
hallucinatory jet engine. And it's hauling ass.
Lindsey jinks left. The object jogs right. She fights the control as her
sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail. K-BAM! Her power comes
back up. Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in
time to see the object racing away in a broad arc. It pulls a high-G turn
and dives straight down.
We see the object zip behind Flatbed. One Night can't see it. The thing
spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the
wall into the abyss until it is lost to view.
HOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed. Her hands are shaking. Suddenly
Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.
BUD (V.O.)
CAB ONE! CAB ONE! Meet me at Flatbed! This
is a diver emergency!! Do you copy? Lindsey?!
She has a hard time focusing on what he's saying. Finally...
LINDSEY
Copy you, Bud. On my way.
CUT TO:
INT. DEEPCORE INFIRMARY -- AN HOUR LATER 80
Jammer is unconscious on a folding cot set up in the tiny cubicle of the
infirmary. Monk, who is cross-trained as a medic as well as a demolitions
man, has hung an IV of something. Bud and the SEAL are in the room, the
others hovering outside.
BUD
Whattya think?
MONK
I'm a medic, which is mostly about patching
holes. This type of thing... there's not much
I can do. The coma could last hours or days.
Bud, torn by guilt, gazes at the big man lying pathetically on the cot.
CUT TO:
INT. CONSOLE MODULE 81
The SEALs, minus Monk, are all gathered inside, debriefing with DeMarco via
closed-circuit video.
DEMARCO (video)
Did any of you see it?
COFFEY
Negative. But there was definitely a Russian
bogey. The Brigman woman saw it.
DEMARCO
CINCLANTFLT's gonna go apeshit. Two Russian
attack subs, a Tango and Victor, have been tracked
within fifty miles of here... and now we don't
know what the hell they are. Okay, I don't have
any choice. I'm confirming you to go to Phase
Two.
Wilhite and Schoenick glance uneasily at each other.
Coffey is silent. He is vibrating with tension... his fists clenched to
prevent the shaking. He is wrestling with the moment, knowing it is, in a
way, a point of no return.
DEMARCO
Is there any problem?
COFFEY
Yes... I mean no. Negative, sir.
Coffey takes a deep breath. Lets it out. Phase Two is clearly a big deal.
CUT TO:
INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B/DARKROOM 82
The maintenance room doubles as a camera workstation. An adjoining head serves
as darkroom. Lindsey is glumly reassembling Cab One's camera housings.
BUD
Did you get anything on the cameras. Video or
anything?
LINDSEY
No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk
about it.
BUD
Fine. Be that way.
LINDSEY
I don't know what I saw. Okay? Coffey wants to
call it a Russian submersible, fine. It's a
Russian submersible. No problem.
BUD
But you think it's something else. What? One
of ours?
LINDSEY
No.
BUD
Whose then? Lindsey? Talk to me...
Lindsey is wrestling with a feeling which is somehow also certain knowledge.
LINDSEY
Jammer saw something in there, something that
scared the hell out him--
BUD
His mixture got screwed up. He panicked and
pranged his regulator.
LINDSEY
But what did he see that made him panic?
BUD
What do you think he saw?
LINDSEY
I don't know. I DON'T KNOW!
Hippy comes pounding up, sticks his head in, gesturing animatedly.
HIPPY
Hey, you guys... hurry up, check this out!
They're announcing it.
They follow him into the corridor, trotting down to the mess hall.
INT. MESS HALL 83
General melee as they rush in, everybody focused on the TV.
CATFISH
Quiet! Quiet!
HIPPY
Turn it up, bozo.
ANCHORMAN
... the Kremlin continues to deny Russian
involvement in the sinking of the Trident sub
USS Montana. The Navy has not released the names
of the 156 crewmembers, who are all presumed
dead at this time. Civilian employees of a
Benthic Petroleum offshore drilling rig--
HIPPY
Hey that's us!
CATFISH
SSSSHHH!
ANCHORMAN
--are apparently participating in the recovery
operation but we have little information about
their involvement. On the scene now is--
FINLER
BOOOOH! We want names!
SONNY
Hey, hey! There's the Explorer.
A LONG LENSE VIDEO SHOT of the Benthic Explorer and the other vessels in a
stormy sea CUTS TO a shot of BILL TYLER, the on-scene reporter, in rain
gear, clutching his microphone. He is on the deck of a Navy support ship,
being used as a staging area from the press, well away from the center of the
operation.
TYLER
--there is a tremendous amount of activity.
With Cuba only 80 miles away, the massive buildup
of US ships and aircraft in the area has drawn
official protest from Havana and Moscow and has
led to a redirection of Soviet warships into the
Caribbean theater.
ANCHORMAN
How would you describe the mood there?
TYLER
The mood is one of suspicion, even confrontation.
A number of Russian and Cuban trawlers,
undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been
circling within a few miles throughout the day,
and Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned
away from the area...
HIPPY
This sucks.
INT. CORRIDOR/SUB BAY 84
Bud, Lindsey, and Hippy walking along the corridor, Hippy in a black mood of
incipient paranoia.
BUD
What's the matter with you?
HIPPY
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time
international incident. Like the Cuban Missile
Crisis or something.
LINDSEY
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
HIPPY
We got Russian subs creeping around. Shit!
Something goes wrong they could say anything
happened down here, man. Give our folks medals,
know what I mean?
BUD
Hippy, just relax. You're making the women
nervous.
LINDSEY
Cute, Virgil.
HIPPY
No, I mean it. Those SEALs aren't telling us
diddly. Something's going on.
BUD
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
HIPPY
Everything is.
One Night is pounding down the corridor from the sub bay.
ONE NIGHT
Hurry up! Coffey's splitting with Flatbed! He
got me to show him the controls, then his guys
suited up and they're rolling.
Bud breaks into a run, passing her.
BUD
Goddamnit! D'you tell him we need it right now?
ONE NIGHT
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked
ASAP.
INT. SUB BAY 85
Bud clears the door in time to see an empty moonpool, roiling with turbulence.
He runs to the edge and looks down. Flatbed is a vague shape moving off.
BUD
Unbelievable.
CUT TO:
EXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY 86
The sky is charcoal, the sea is a mountain range of gray slopes. Waves
thunder over the foredeck, whipped by eighty-know winds. Men in life
jackets scurry like insects. Off the port bow, the ASW destroyer ALBANY
vanishes and reappears among waves sixty feet tall. McBride scream orders
that can't be heard to the crewmen on deck. He staggers back along the bridge
railing.
INT./EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY 87
McBride steps into the quiet of the control room. He turns on De Marco.
MCBRIDE
We're trying to get unhooked and get out of
here... and your boys go sightseeing!
DEMARCO
They'll be back in two hours.
MCBRIDE
Two hours?! We're gonna be getting the shit
kicked out of us by our friend Fred in two hours!
De Marco's expression is infuriatingly calm... icy. McBride looks at his
watch and swears under his breath.
CUT TO:
EXT. USS MONTANA WRECK SITE 88
For a second time the black hull of the ballistic missile sub is illuminated
by diver's lights. Tiny figures, the divers move like moths around a distant
streetlight. Wilhite, Monk and Schoenick are clustered around an open missile
hatch. Using a large lift bag, they are removing the frangible fiberglass,
or 'diaphragm'. Coffey pilots Flatbed with increasing deftness, deploying
the big arm to aid in the work.
DOWN ANGLE as the diaphragm lifts away... revealing the blunt nose of the
TRIDENT C-4 MISSLE. Like looking down the barrel of a gun at the bullet
aimed right at you.

This was denied--
It continues. Bud looks at Lindsey. She turns to him, expression grim.
LINDSEY
Bud, this is big time.
CUT TO:
EXT. MONTANA WRECKSITE 90
The divers are working head-first in the missile's launch tube. Monk reads
from a plasticized card, directing the other two step by step. The arcane

WILHITE (filtered)
Separation sequencer disconnected. Next?
MONK (filtered)
Remove explosive bolts one through six in

SCHOENICK (filtered)
Check... removing bolt one.
INT. DEEPCORE 91
ON THE RIG CREW, watching. Bathed in the light of the video screen.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
... just learned that Soviet negotiators have
walked out of the strategic arms limitation
summit in protest over the incident this morning.
Bud switches the channel.
ANOTHER NEWSCASTER
... US and NATO military forces have been put on
full alert worldwide this morning in the wake
of...
BUD
It's on every channel.
Bud switches again. Reception is getting worse as the storm affect the
satellite down-link to Explorer. THE SCREEN shows a reporter on a city
street, stopping people at random. Their answers are edited together:
YOUNG WOMAN
You just feel so hopeless. You can see it coming,
but what can you do? What can anyone do?
CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Hey, they don't want war any more than we do.
You think about it, you say... hey, they love
their kids too. So why are we doing this?
He is replaced by a self-righteous, middle-aged woman.
WOMAN
If the Russians sank that submarine, they deserve
what they got and a lot more, if you ask me,
and you did. I think we've been pussyfooting
around with them long enough.
EXT. USS MONTANA 92
It is now clear what the SEALs are doing. Using large lift bags and Flatbed's
big arm, they have pulled one of the Trident C-4 missiles partway out of its
launch tube, and have partially disassembled the nose-shroud, exposing
several of the MIRV warheads within.
Moving very carefully, Wilhite and Schoenick ease one of the individual MIRVs
out of its bracket. Hanging under a lift-bag in a jerry-rigged harness, the
three-foot long warhead is move gently by the divers to the back of Flatbed.
INT. DEEPCORE/VIDEO SCREEN 93
Another man in the street interview, tortured by static.
MAN
Scared? I'm scared ____-less. But if it happens
it happens, nothing I can do about it. Right?
So why think about it?
CUT TO:
INT. SUB-BAY 94
Flatbed surfaces in boiling foam. The rig crew are all waiting. Like a
crack pit-crew Bud's people leap onto Flatbed while its deck is still awash
and start to work on to Navy divers, unsealing their helmets and uncoupling
their umbilicals. Hippy and Bud start to untie a cylindrical object wrapped
in one of the SEAL's gear bags. Coffey emerges from the hatch.
COFFEY
Don't touch that. Just step away. Now!
HIPPY
Excusez moi.
BUD
Coffey, we're a little pressed for time.
COFFEY
Monk, Schoenick... secure the package.
The two SEALs unlash the object in the black bag. Bud an Lindsey exchange a
glance. He glares at Coffey as they pass each other. One Night nimbly
climbs the hatch-tower and drops in. Bud swings the heavy hatch up,
balancing it, and grins down at One Night.
BUD
This ain't no drill, slick. Make me proud.
ONE NIGHT
Piece of cake, baby.
He swings the hatch closed with a CLANG.
CUT TO:
EXT. DEEPCORE 95
The big A-frame, massive as a railroad bridge, to which the umbilical from
the Explorer is attached. Flatbed rises INTO FRAME arcing around the
coupling mechanism F.G. One Night deploys the big hydraulic arm.
It unfold from Flay bed like a huge steel spider leg, its claw-like 'gripper'
opening.
INT./EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY 96
An ALARM sounds stridently on the dynamic-positioning console.
BENDIX
We're losing number two thruster. Bearing's
going.
INT. THRUSTER ROOM TWO 97
Deep in one of the catamaran hulls, the positioning thruster motor is
SCREAMING like a steel banshee above its usual roar. It EXPLODES with smoke
and shrapnel. A roaring fire erupts. Crewmen run shouting in the smoke.
INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE 98
Now a KLAXON is going off as the ship begins to slew in the high winds.
BENDIX
It's not holding. We're swinging out of
position!
EXT. EXPLORER'S DECK/LAUNCH WELL 99
As the ship slews, the umbilical is drawn off vertical. It goes tight as a
bowstring. Pulled to the edge of the launch well, it rips down the side
with a godawful screech, tearing loose ladders and floats.
EXT. DEEPCORE/A-FRAME 100
Flatbed's manipulator has gripped the de-coupling mechanism when the cable
suddenly pulls taut. The sub is jerked sideways, its grip dislodged. We
see One Night get tossed around inside.
INT. DEEPCORE 101
Lindsey is in the corridor with a cup of tea when the whole rig BOOMS LIKE A
GONG and lurches sideways. She's wearing her tea when Bud tears through a
doorway and goes pounding past her. The intercom blares...
HIPPY (intercom)
Bud to control! Emergency! Bud to Control!
Bud claws his way up the ladder to level two. The rig BOOMS and shudders
as...
EXT. DEEPCORE 102
The rig begins to move. The enormous skid breaks loose. Start to slide,
plowing furrows in the bottom. One Night junks the controls, pivoting her
submersible as the A-frame looms toward her.
INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE 103
Bud runs in, past Hippy, and grabs the mike.
BUD
Topside, topside... pay out some slack, we're
getting dragged!
EXT. EXPLORER DECK 104
The winch man staggers along the railing, blasted by 80-knot winds. He
sprints for the base of the enormous crane which supports the umbilical
winch. A wave blasts him into the bulkhead. He half-crawls to the ladder
going up to the winch-house. As he climbs the winch's heave-compensator
slides up and down, FILLING FRAME behind him.
It is bottoming-out with a sound like a piledriver, overloaded by the strain
on the cable. It chooses that moment to fail. GRINDING CRASH OF METAL.
INT./EXT. DEEPCORE CONTROL MODULE 105
Lindsey has joined Bud, looking out the front viewport.
LINDSEY
We're heading right for the drop off!
EXT. EXPLORER DECK 106
The deck is ripped upward as the entire 40-ton crane is pulled over by the
weight of Deepcore. It topples in the launch well with a roar of tortured
steel that rivals the storm. An EXPLOSION OF WATER. UNDERWATER, the crane
tumbles between the twin hulls. Trailing a vortex of foam and debris, it
roars down on us, FILLING FRAME WITH BLACKNESS.
INT. EXPLORER BRIDGE 107
McBride stares in shock at the churning cauldron of the launch well. Grabs
the underwater telephone.
MCBRIDE
Bud! We've lost the crane!
BUD (V.O.)
What? Say again.
MCBRIDE
THE CRANE! WE'VE LOST THE CRANE. IT'S ON ITS
WAY TO YOU!!
INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE 108
Everyone is stunned by what is happening. Lindsey fires up the sonar.
LINDSEY
Got it! It's dropping straight to us.
She puts the signal over the speakers and the room fills with eerie PINGING.
Bud shouts over the intercom.
BUD
Rig for impact! Seal all exterior hatches.
Move it! Let's go!
VARIOUS ANGLES, QUICK CUTS, as everyone runs to comply:
The rig crew pounding down the narrow corridors. Diving through low
hatchways. Hatches are closed and the wheels spun down. Hippy puts into a
ZIP-LOK BAG and seals it.
EXT. DEEPCORE 109
The umbilical drops down in slack loops out of the blackness above, draping
itself over the habitat in large coils. One Night pilots her submersible
feverishly among the falling loops. She banks and twists. A length of heavy
umbilical slams onto her neck, tipping the sub.
She manages to get out from under it a keep going.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 110
Through the front viewport they can see the coils of cable piling up in front
of the rig. The hull booms with impacts as the massive stuff hits.
Everyone hold their breath as the sonar return-pings get closer... and
closer. And closer...
An ENORMOUS SHAPE plunged into the floodlight in front of the rig.
K-WHAM!! The 40-ton crane hits like a flatiron thirty feet in front of them.
A clean miss. Much WHOOPING AND CHEERING. Then...
The crane topples slowly over the back. It rolls down the slope of the drop-
off, gathering speed. Then tumbles over the cliff into the abyssal canyon.
The coiled umbilical starts to pay out after it like rope after a harpoon.
And they're still attached.
LINDSEY
Oh shit.
An agonizing few seconds. Then... the cable pulls taut.
K-BOOM!! The rig is slammed by the shock. Everyone is knocked off his feet,
into walls and equipment.
EXT. DEEPCORE 111
The rig begins to slide. It tilts over the embankment and grinds down the
slope of the drop-off in a cloud of silt. The cable pulling it inexorably
toward the cliff. The framework twists and slams into rocks. SCREECHING
AND GROANING of tortured steel.
INT. DEEPCORE/CORRIDOR/LADDERWELL/MAIN CORRIDOR 112
All hell has broken loose. SIRENS, SCREAMING, a KLAXON HOOTING moronically.
Bud sprints from Control, bouncing off the corridor walls as the rig
lurches and tilts. The lights go out. Emergency light come on. He trips
and falls, scrambles up, running on.
IN THE LADDERWELL of trimodule C, Lindsey runs toward the machine rooms.
K-BOOM! A searing bright EXPLOSION in the electrical room. Flames roar
through the doorway. She dashed to a seawater hose hanging nearby and starts
to unroll it. She sees Coffey and Schoenick in maintenance, lashing down
the mystery package.
LINDSEY
Hey! Get on this hose, you turkeys!
INT. TRIMODULE C/COMPRESSOR ROOM 113
Monk is working in a spray of seawater, turning valves to stop the flow of
ruptured pipes. Behind him, a wall of flame blossoms through the door from
the electrical room, driving the back with the heat. A reservoir-tanks
breaks loose from one of the compressor assemblies. In rolls at him,
crushing his legs against machinery. The fire roars into the room.
INT. SUB BAY 114
Hippy runs in. The place is going nuts. Water floods from the moonpool as
the rig tilts. Wilhite is dancing across the deck, leaping over compressed-
gas cylinders which are rolling around loose. Cab One jumps clear off its
cradle and slides SCREECHING across the deck. Wilhite, running before the
12-tom juggernaut, had no place to go. The SEAL dives into the churning
moonpool. Cab One slams into the end wall, then spins and rolls toward
Hippy.
He starts to run. Drop something. Looks back.
Beany, in his zip-loc bag, is lying in the path of the slide submersible.
Hippy runs back. Scoops up the baggie. Cab One FILLS FRAME behind him.
He makes it through the door an instant before the thing hits behind him,
buckling the steel doorframe.
Wilhite is clawing up the sheep skirting of the moonpool. He gets his fingers
over the top. Pulls himself up...
A steel helium tank slams against his fingers, crushing them, and he falls
back. More tanks bounce over the lip of the pool, hammering Wilhite down
into the foaming water.
He doesn't surface.
EXT. DEEPCORE 115
The rig is sliding to the edge of the cliff. Beyond it... the bottomless
pit of the Cayman Trough. It slams, crushing and twisting, into a rock
outcropping and stops, hanging over the precipice.
INT. TRIMODULE A/QUARTERS 116
Perry is trapped as the trimodule floods with stunning swiftness. He makes
it through an emergency hatch between floors but can't get it closed. The
inrushing tide blasts it open. He scramble upward to the next hatch. Spins
the wheel. No time. He is slammed against the ceiling by the force of the
water.
OMITTED A116
INT. DRILL ROOM B116
Lew Finler, Tommy Ray Dietz, and Lupton McWhirter fight their way toward the
door as the drill room floods rapidly. Ahead, the big automated watertight
door is closing like a motorized bank-vault. They reach it just as it is
closing, but can't prevail against the strength of the motors. FROM THE FAR
SIDE, we can see them screaming soundlessly at the tiny pressure window in
the door. We can hear the dull THUNK of their pounding.
INT. TRIMODULE C/LADDERWELL AND COMPRESSOR ROOM 117
Coffey and Schoenick, in emergency breathing masks, are fighting the fire with
a seawater hose and fire extinguishers. Smoke and steam choke the dark
chambers.
Nearby, Lindsey grabs Hippy's arm as he is running past and drags him into the
blazing compressor room. Hands him her seawater hose. Wide-eyes, he starts
blasting everything in sight with water.
LINDSEY
No! Hold it on me!
She rushed into the teeth of the fire as Hippy blasts her with a spray of
water, following her into the intense heat. She grabs Monk, who is
semiconscious, and drags him out of the blazing room... Hippy dancing back
with the hose, tripping, blasting her in the face.
But it works. They get Monk clear.
INT. DRILL ROOM CORRIDOR 118
Bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the
drill room swirl above the pressure window, obscuring the faces of the
trapped men. He claws futility at the door. The motors and the fail-safe
latching mechanism are on the opposite side. Through the pressure window he
watches helplessly as they drown. We don't see what he sees, but we know
what he sees. Suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing
torrent thunders in. Bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor.
He scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the
corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably. He's
not going to make it. He reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through.
Grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with
the strength of this arms. It doesn't work. The steel door closes on the
fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe.
But something amazing happens. His wedding ring lodges between the door and
frame, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from
sealing and locking.
It resists tons of pressure, denting but not collapsing.
The freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear.
BUD
Heeyy!! HHHEEEYYY!!
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, Catfish and Sonny come pounding up. They see
his face at the tiny window and his hand jammed in the door. Sonny wedges
a crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry. Catfish whips open his
jackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator. He is
sprayed with red hydraulic fluid, machine blood.
Together they force open the door. Bud is blown through in a torture of
water. Sonny is thrown back into some pipes. Breaks his arm.
Together they somehow heave the door shut manually, cutting off the flow.
Catfish hammers the fail-safe latch home with the crowbar.
Bud lies gasping and shivering... staring at the tiny band of metal that
saved him.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. DEEPCORE/ONE HOUR LATER A118
LOOKING DOWN THE WALL of the canyon as Big Geek moves beneath us, tilting up
to show Deepcore perched at the very edge of the abyss. The rig is twisted
and dented, covered with loops of umbilical, trimodule-A a mass of wreckage.
The ROV passes across the front of the control module. Through the front
port, two figures can be seen in the light of a single emergency lamp.
SONNY (V.O. static)
Mayday, mayday. This is Deepcore Two calling
Benthic Explorer. Do you read, over?
INT. CONTROL MODULE B118
Sonny flips some switches on the UQC acoustic transceiver. Tries again.
SONNY
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer. Do you read,
over? This is Deepcore--
BUD
Forget it, Sonny. They're gone.
INT. TRIMODULE C 119
Bud walks down the corridor from control, slowly... as if carrying a great
weight. The air is still thick with smoke. The power off... everything
lit by emergency lights. Makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess
hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the
storage room across the hall. Jammer is still unconscious. Coffey and
Schoenick bring Monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table. He is
conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted.
BUD
Did you find Wilhite?
COFFEY
No.
He and Bud lock eyes. Bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze
blames Coffey. He turns away.
COFFEY
Brigman.
(Bud turns)
I was under orders. I had no choice.
Coffey's manner is subdued, contrite. A marked contrast to his previous
brusque arrogance. He's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the
tight brotherhood of a SEAL unit. Bud's anger is not dispelled. But he
can't address it now. He moves on.
PAST THE INFIRMARY, where Sonny Dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken
arm. He cries out in pain, cursing at himself. LOOKING DOWN THE CENTRAL WELL
as Bud crosses. Down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level
of the module is flooded. Catfish is down there welding, sending shivering
reflections through the chamber.
INT. MACHINE ROOM 120
Lindsey is working, up to her knees in water. She is covered with grease,
tools scattered around. Bud puts his hand on her shoulder. She looks up,
blows some hair out of her eyes.
BUD
What's the scoop, ace?
LINDSEY
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if
I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the
mains, which are a total melt-down.
Rather than trigger anger and invective, the disaster seems to have affected
her in a different way. She's accepted the situation, now that's it's done,
and is immersing herself in technical tasks, which are for her therapeutic.
BUD
Need some help?
LINDSEY
Thanks. No, I can handle it. Bud... there
won't be enough to run the heaters. In a couple
hours this place is going to be as cold as a
meat locker.
BUD
What about O-2?
LINDSEY
Brace yourself. We've got about 12 hours worth
if we close off the sections we're not using.
BUD
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
LINDSEY
I can extend that. There's some storage tanks
outboard on the wrecked module. I'll have to go
outside to tie onto them.
She goes back to her task, working efficiently with a socket wrench.
BUD
Hey, Lins...
(she looks up)
I'm glad your here.
LINDSEY
Yeah? Well I'm not.
OMITTED 121
OMITTED 122
The sub bay is still a mess. Dark. A few battery-operated lamps. Flatbed
is back, floating in the moonpool.
One Night and Hippy are in deep concentration, piloting the two ROVs in a
damage survey of the rig. Bud comes up behind them, check her screen first.
BIG GEEK'S MONITOR shows a view of the aft section of the rig. The drilling
derrick had collapsed across Cab Three, totaling it. A girder is jammed
through its acrylic front dome.
ONE NIGHT
Right through the brainpan. Deader'n dogshit,
boss.
BUD
(to Hippy)
Where're you?
HIPPY
Quarters. Level two.
INT. TRIMODULE A/QUARTERS A123
Little Geek rises up through the open central hatch, pivoting in a circle to
scan the flooded interior.
INT. SUB BAY/R.O.V. STATION B123
TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, LITTLE GEEK'S POV. The interior of the structure is a
shambles. The lights of the little robot fall upon a figure... Perry.
Lying on the deck, almost looking like he's asleep.
HIPPY
That's Perry.
BUD
(lets his breath out slowly)
That's it then. Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and
Perry. Jesus.
HIPPY
(gestured at the screen)
Do we just leave him there?
BUD
Yeah, for now. Our first priority's to get
something to breathe.
CUT TO:
EXT. DEEPCORE 124
Catfish and Lindsey, in suits and helmets, drop down from the glare of the
moonpool onto the dark sea floor under the rig. Walking, they pull their
umbilicals behind them and head out through the twisted wreckage. Little
Geek follows along like a dog at their heels. They settle beside a valve
assembly at the base of the wrecked module.
LINDSEY
Cat, you tie onto this manifold. There's some
tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check
them out.
CATFISH
You watch yourself.
He begins to attach one end of a coiled-up high-pressure hose to a manifold.
She takes the other end of the hose and moves off into the darkness. Little
Geek goes with her faithfully.
INT. SUB BAY 125
Cab One is hanging from the overhead crane while One Nigh works to repair it.
Bud is nearby, tending hose for the divers and handing her tools. Talking
while they work. Hippy is across the moonpool running Little Geek.
ONE NIGHT
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.
(he hands it to her)
So there you were--
BUD
There we were, side by side, on the same ship,
for two months. I'm tool-pusher and we're
testing this automated derrick of hers. So, we
get back on the beach and... we're living
together.
ONE NIGHT
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
BUD
We were due to go back out on the same ship.
Six months of tests. If you were married you
got a state-room. Otherwise it was bunks.
ONE NIGHT
Okay, good reason. Then what?
BUD
It was alright for a while, you know. But then
she got promoted to project engineer on this
thing, couple years ago.
ONE NIGHT
She went front-office on you. Tighten that for
me, right there. That's it.
BUD
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive--
Son of a--!!
He's jammed his fingers with a wrench torquing down a bolt. Whips his hand
out.
BUD
She didn't leave me... she just left me behind.
She puts her arm around his shoulders, somehow managing to be fraternal,
maternal and suggestive all at the same time.
ONE NIGHT
Bud, let me tell you something. She ain't half
as smart as she thinks she is.
She smiles and pretends to kink Lindsey's air-hose.
ACROSS THE CHAMBER, Hippy scowls as Little Geek's screen starts to go haywire
with interference.
HIPPY
Hey, Lindsey, you reading me? Over.
OMITTED 126
EXT. DEEPCORE/TRIMODULE A 127
Catfish is working on one side of the wrecked module while Lindsey is on the
other, out of sight. She is standing on the bottom at the base of the
wreckage, checking valves on a rack of oxygen bottles amongst the wreckage.
Right at the edge of the canyon wall. Behind her is a sheer drop to
nothingness
LINDSEY
Yeah, Hippy, I read you. What's the matter?
The reply is GARBLED by a wash of static. Then, for no apparent reason,
Lindsey's helmet light begins to dim out. Little Geek's lights fade. His
motors whine to a stop.
ON CATFISH, as his lights drop to candleglows.
INT. SUB BAY A127
The emergency lights are dimming, like a brownout. Bud grabs the diver
intercom mike.
BUD
Lins, how're you doing? Lindsey?
EXT. TRIMODULE A 128
ON LINDSEY, as she fiddles with her lights and transceiver pack.
LINDSEY
Catfish... I got a problem here. You there?
Catfish?
Behind her, SOMETHING rises from the depths.
It is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the Montana wreck.
It comes right up behind her. She doesn't know it's there. It hovers
sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look. She
becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her. She turns
slowly. We see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in
her faceplate.
A more powerful glow washes up onto her from below.
Her eyes go down. She gasps, absolutely stunned...
Above the edge of the wall, AN ENORMOUS SHAPE RISES SILENTLY OUT OF THE
DEPTHS. Over sixty feet across. It looks like a blown glass manta ray, its
transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow.
Lindsey stand before it, unable to move. Absolutely rapt.
Captivated by its ethereal beauty. It begins to turn, majestically, one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her. She reaches up. Touches it
as it passes over her.
Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized.
The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall. She
is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water.
About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos.
She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful
machine glides into the depths. Gets all set for a shot and...
WOOSH! The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her.
She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'. She pivots, trying to
get a shot of the little one as it zig-zags down along the wall, fast as a
meteor. CLICK. She get a shot a second before it disappears.
From around the flank of the rig module, Catfish appears. Their com-sets
come backs to life, along with their lights.
LINDSEY
You better not say you missed that.
CATFISH
Missed what?
CUT TO:
INT. DEEPCORE/MESS HALL 129
TIGHT ON SLIDE STRIP. Lindsey's fingertip in for scale. The shot is black
with a little squiggle of light in the center. Pathetic.
BUD
Nice shot, Lins.
SONNY
What is that? You drop your dive light?
WIDER, SHOWING THE GROUP huddled around Lindsey who has her freshly-processed
slide roll laid out on the pinball machine, using it as a light table.
LINDSEY
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little
one right here. You can see how it's kind of
zigging around.
BUD
If you say so. It could be anything.
LINDSEY
I'm telling you what is there. You're just not
hearing. The impulses somehow aren't getting
from you ears to your brainpan. There's something
down there. Something not... us.
She looks around. Sees a lot of skepticism in the eyes around her.
CATFISH
Y'all could be more specific.
LINDSEY
Not us. Not human. Get it? Something non-
human, but intelligent...
HIPPY
You mean like Coffey?
Lindsey is reddening. Despite her conviction, this is really hard.
LINDSEY
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
HIPPY
Non-Terrestrial Intelligence. NTIs. Yeah, I
like that better then UFOs. Although that
works too... Underwater Flying Objects.
Hippy is not really mocking her. He's actually into it. But it has that
effect. Catfish is eyeing Lindsey like he's never seen her before.
CATFISH
Are we talkin' little space friend here?
HIPPY
Right on! Hot rods of the Gods. Right, Lins?
Hey, no really! It could be NTIs. The CIA has
known about them for years. They abduct people
all the time. There was this woman I knew in
Albuquerque who--
LINDSEY
Hippy, do me a favor... stay off my side.
Bud takes her firmly by the arm. Heads her out into the corridor.
BUD
Lindsey, will you step into my office for a
minute...
INT. CORRIDOR/LADDER WELL 130
He propels her along the corridor, away from the mess hall doorway. They
face each other in the narrow space.
BUD
Jesus, Lindsey--
LINDSEY
Bud, something really important is happening
here.
BUD
Look. I'm just trying to hold this situation
together. I can't allow you to cause this kind
of hysteria--
LINDSEY
Who's hysterical? Nobody's hysterical!
They're talking across each other, not connecting. Bud weary and frustrated.
Lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter.
BUD
All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your
fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.
LINDSEY
I saw something! I'm not going to go back there
and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry.
BUD
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
LINDSEY
I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do
I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of
pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
BUD
No.
LINDSEY
Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay? You know me
better than anybody in the world. Now watch my
lips... I saw these things. I touched one of
them. And it wasn't some clunky steel can like
we would build... it glided. It was the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Bud is stilled by her intensity. She moves close to him. Eyes alive and
luminous.
LINDSEY
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive.
Like a... dance of light. Bud, you have to
trust me... please. I don't think they mean us
harm. I don't know how I know that, it's just a
feeling.
BUD
How can I go on a feeling? You think Coffey's
going to go on you 'feeling'?
LINDSEY
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks
and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear.
Bud, you have to look with better eyes than
that.
Bud has been taking this all in. His eyes tracking her face. He closes his
eyes, taking a deep breath. It's so hard for him to do this, but...
BUD
I can't, Lindsey. I'm sorry. How can I?
CUT TO:
INT. MESS HALL -- LATER 131
Coffey has Bud, Lindsey and several of the rig crew gathered for a little
summit. Lindsey is withdrawn, sitting far from the others, a self-imposed
exile. They're all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves. Their
breath shows in the air.
COFFEY
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar
shack and the exterior cameras. We need early
warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
LINDSEY
(rolling her eyes)
Gimme a break! Coffey, these things live three
and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal
trench! Trust me... they're not speaking
Russian.
Coffey looks at her for a moment, then goes on as if she hadn't spoke.
COFFEY
(to One Night)
Why haven't you finished repairs on the
hydrophone transmitter yet?
ONE NIGHT
I was having my nails done.
Coffey is sweating, despite the chill. Keeps his hands clenched in fists so
they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten.
COFFEY
Get something straight. You people are under my
authority--
CATFISH
Look, podner... we don't work for you, we don't
take orders from you, and we don't much like you.
In addition to which your momma dresses you
funny.
Coffey's eyes are straight razors. He slashes them from face to face. You
can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation
in front of his own men. Bud defuses it.
BUD
'Fish'?
CATFISH
Yuh?
BUD
Take the first watch in sonar. Hippy, you
handle the exterior surveillance. One Night, see
if you can get that transmitter working for me,
okay?
ONE NIGHT
Gimme a couple of hours.
HOLD ON COFFEY as everyone leaves. Winding tighter.
CUT TO:
INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B -- LATER 132
Coffey and Schoenick are bending over the warhead. They have a small port
removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an ELECTRONIC DETONATOR. The
black box Lindsey glimpsed earlier. As the two SEALs work like surgeons, we
see past Coffey's shoulder to a hemispherical window behind him, which looks
out into the perpetual blackness. Something appears... a goofy shark face.
Big Geek rises silently in front of the port. It moves a little, trying to
get a peek over Coffey's shoulder.
INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK 133
Hippy is twiddling his joysticks, watching the screen like a ferret.
HIPPY
Come on... move to the left... just a little
more... come on, A.J. Squared Away... that's
it--
ON THE SCREEN, Geek's POV. Coffey is blocking Hippy's view of whatever it is
they're working on. Abruptly, be moves. The warhead is lying there in plain
sight, detonator wires hooked up. Hippy's eyes bug out. He knows exactly
what it is.
HIPPY
Pretty radical, guys. Pretty radical.
He hurries to the VCR and puts it into RECORD.
INT. CONTROL MODULE/ROV SHACK -- MINUTES LATER 134
Video image of the SEALs working. It FREEZES on a clear view of the warhead.
HIPPY (V.O.)
Say hello to MIRV.
Bud has his face right up to screen. He frowns, skeptical.
HIPPY
Come on, man. What else could it be?
BUD
Why bring it here?
HIPPY
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep
it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the
nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in
the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot.
Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Bud whips around. Lindsey, standing quietly in the doorway. It's apparent
from expression she's been watching them for some time. She looks ready to
kill somebody. Then she's gone.
INT. CORRIDOR 135
Bud catches up to her in the corridor, trying to put the brakes on her.
LINDSEY
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about
it, I will.
BUD
Lindsey! Wait a second--
She reaches the watertight door to Maintenance Room B. It's locked. Before
Bud can stop her she grabs a fire-extinguisher off the wall and pounds on
the steel door like a big gong. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
Needless to say, it opens. She pushes past Schoenick, see the bomb lying
there naked.
LINDSEY
You've got some huevos bringing this...
thing... into my rig! With everything that's
been going on up in the world, you bring a
nuclear weapon in here? Does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
COFFEY
You don't need to know the details of this
mission... you're better off if you don't.
LINDSEY
You're right... I don't. I just need to know
that this thing is out of here! You hear me,
Roger Ramjet?
COFFEY
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment
to this mission. I believe the stress is
affecting you.
(to Schoenick)
Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a
tranquilizer.
Schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip.
LINDSEY
Bullshit, you can't do that. Oww... goddamnit!
Lindsey goes bananas, trying to get Schoenick's big hands off her arms. Bud
slams his hand down on the intercom button.
BUD
Emergency! Maintenance room B. Emergency!
He pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on Coffey... warning him
with a look that is not to be messed with. Coffey is braced back against the
worktable... an odd stance, with one arm behind his back. Suddenly there's
a crowd outside the door as Catfish, Hippy, One Night, and Sonny come running
up. Confrontation time.
Sirens going. About a million volts of electricity in the air. Bud braces
Schoenick.
BUD
Let her go. Do it... right now.
He does. Lindsey jerks away. Rubs her arms.
LINDSEY
You dumb jarhead motherf--
BUD
Chill out, Lindsey!!
CATFISH
What's the problem?
Everyone is frozen in place. Bud a Coffey... snake and mongoose, glaring.
Bud pulls Lindsey back into the corridor.
BUD
Nothing. We were just leaving.
(to her)
Weren't we?
ANGLE FROM BEHIND COFFEY, as Bud's group moves out of sight up the corridor.
Hands behind his back. In his hand, cocked, finger on the trigger, is the
.45. He turns and sets it on the table, steadying himself as if in the wind.
he seems to sag. When he looks at Schoenick, his eyes are wounds. A hunted
animal. Voice shaky.
COFFEY
They can't be trusted. They're turning against
us. We may have to take... steps.
INT. CORRIDOR 136
Lindsey, Bud, Hippy. Bud slows, letting them trail behind the others.
BUD
Lins, stay away from that guy. I mean it.
HIPPY
Yeah. The dude's in bad shape... you see his
hands?
LINDSEY
He's got the shakes?
BUD
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off
from chain of command. He's exhibiting symptoms
of pressure-induced psychosis. And he's got a
nuclear weapon. So, as a personal favor to me...
will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
HIPPY
Man, I give this a sphincter-factor of about
nine point five.
INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM B 137
Coffey goes to the dome port. Looks past his shrunken and twisted reflection
into the void. Eternal night.
ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE. Coffey's face in the window. Stuck to the acrylic
bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws. Coffey
stares out. Behind his eyes, his brain is like that cat, just hanging on,
spreadeagle and screaming.
CUT TO:
INT. SUB-BAY/DIVE-PREP AREA 138
Under a single worklight, a couple of conspirators. Lindsey and Hippy hunch
over Big Geek. The ROV grins maniacally with goofy shark teeth.
LINDSEY
Look, you can just punch into his little chip
where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
HIPPY
Well, yeah, but the tether off it ain't gonna
be fancy. When he gets down there he'll just
sit, like a dumb-shit. Unless something wanders
through view of the camera, you'll get nada.
LINDSEY
Let's go for it. We could get lucky.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 139
ONE SURVEILLANCE MONITOR. Lindsey and Hippy next to Big Geek. Their voices
are tinny but intelligible.
HIPPY (V.O.)
I don't know. I really oughta talk to Bud about
this.
E.C.U. COFFEY. Watching them in the dark. Alone.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
No. Just you and me. We get some proof, then
tell them. Hippy, look... if was can prove to
Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off
the button a little.
HIPPY (V.O.)
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more
than whatever's down there. A.J. Squared Away
goddamn jarhead robot. Okay, gimme a couple
hours on this.
Coffey watches, his jaw clenched.
INT. QUARTERS/MESS HALL 140
The lights are down. Those who can are grabbing some sleep. Snoring comes
from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes. In the mess hall, Catfish and
Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets. The cold has gotten
intense. Water drips. The walls sweat with condensation. Lindsey can see
her breath as she makes coffee. She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a
face in a pile of blankets. A hand comes out, takes the coffee.
MONK
Thanks.
Lindsey sips hers, staring. Her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless
pit. She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping. His soft
snoring downshifts into a loud rasp. Lindsey touches him gently on the
shoulder.
LINDSEY
Virgil, turn on your side.
Bud grunts and turns without waking, an automatic response. The snoring
stops. It is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two
have logged together.
CUT TO:
INT. SONAR SHACK 141
Sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens. Too comfortable.
He's asleep, chin on his chest. On the main passive-sonar screen, an almost
imperceptibly faint trace appears. A HUM, which is by now familiar, becomes
audible. Sonny shifts in his seat. Doesn't wake.
INT. SUB BAY 142
Hippy puts his tools away, finished with the modifications to Big Geek.
HIPPY
All set, big guy. Hey, I told you to wipe that
grin off your face.
He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door. Switches off
the lights. Goes out.
Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool. A beat. Then...
A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending
shadows shifting across the top of the chamber. The surface begins to
pulsate.
Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering
pseudopod as big around as a man's body. The transparent form pulses... an
amoebic mass shivering in the air.
It stretches, becoming a more refined form. Like a blindly probing glass
python, it elongates and weaves across the room. It extends and extends,
stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle. The 'head' or tip,
a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward,
as if it can see where it's going.
INT. CORRIDOR 143
Hippy trudges along the dark corridor. He reaches the men's head and goes in.
As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor
B.G. It 'looks' left and right. Then extends the length of the corridor,
holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake.
INT. TRIMODULE B/LADDERWELL/BUNKROOM/MESS HALL 144
LOOKING DOWN three levels through the central ladderwell between the
cylinders. The pseudopod enters and undulates upward.
FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside.
Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious. Jammer is still unconscious. The
pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.
IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet. Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her
chair, her head buried in her arms on the table. The shimmering tentacle
enters the room in total silence. It sways gracefully in to air, searching.
It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying
everything. It moves past Lindsey. Sensing something, she lifts her head,
turning... sees the apparition next to her.
Her eyes go wide. Amazement, but not fear. The tentacle is moving on, still
searching. Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth.
Bud blinks twice, then freezes. When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging
open like a total goon.
Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.
Catfish cracks one eye open. Turns away. Turns right back... both eyes open
now. Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them. It seems to
recognize Lindsey. It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to
her. She holds her ground, fascinated.
The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face. It is water,
still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey. She gasps in surprise.
The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression.
Lindsey laughs involuntarily. It laughs... without sound. Lindsey makes a
face, sticking out her tongue... testing it.
The liquid-Lindsey does the same. Bud has just had the rug jerked out from
under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty
will, considering.
BUD
(whispering)
I think it likes you.
LINDSEY
It's trying to communicate.
Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's.
She reaches out her hand slowly. Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface.
Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features.
Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's
dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways. She draws her wet
fingers out and studies them, amazed. Touches one fingertip to her tongue.
LINDSEY
Seawater.
The pseudopod pulls back from her. It loops in the air dramatically, full
circle... and ties itself into a knot. As the knot tightens down, it melts
back into the body. The 'disappearing knot' trick.
Lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a
magic show. She is transported.
LINDSEY
Show off.
She looks at Bud. He grins broadly. He's with her now.
The stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room. Out to the
corridor
INT. SUB-BAY 145
Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way, through the dive-prep area. They see
the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk. Coffey's mind is
blown. We can smell the insulation burning. He just stares.
INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B 146
The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead. It studies
the device for a few seconds. Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in
time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the
warhead. They begin to lift it off its cart.
INT. SUB BAY 147
Coffey finally jump-starts his brain. In a flash of insight, he runs to the
big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor. He
and Schoenick heave on the door. Like a guillotine blade it slices
effortlessly through it.
VARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the
body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor. It reverts to
nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater. As the tendrils dissolve,
the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed. ON COFFEY'S SIDE ON THE
DOOR, however, the ""stump"" rears back like a cobra. It withdraws rapidly into
the moonpool. The glow fades away.
INT. SONAR SHACK 148
Sonny wakes up with a start as the HUM revs up into a LOUD WHINE and then
fades away. He scrambles to track it. Too late.
INT. CORRIDOR 149
Hippy emerges from the can and looks down, puzzled, at the puddle running the
length of the corridor. He missed the whole thing.
INT. MESS HALL 150
Light on. Everybody there. Lindsey is really strutting, high on life, now
that she's been proven right.
LINDSEY
Okay, raise your hand if you think that was a
Russian water-tentacle. Lieutenant? No? Well,
a breakthrough.
Coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson in ""The Shining"".
Bud give her a warning look. Don't poke at the rattler.
BUD
You done impressing yourself, ace?
ONE NIGHT
No way that could just be seawater.
LINDSEY
They must've learned how to control water... I
mean at a molecular level. They can plasticize
it, polymerize it... whatever. Put it under
intelligent control.
BUD
Maybe their whole technology is based on that.
Controlling water.
Coffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees. His hands are out of sight. His
arm is moving in a slow rhythm. We can't see what he's doing.
HIPPY
That thing was probably their version of Big
Geek... like an ROV.
CATFISH
Just checking is out, huh? How come?
ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE, showing what Coffey is doing. He has his K-BAR KNIFE
gripped white-knuckle in one hand. He is drawing it slowly and repeatedly
across the skin of the other forearm. Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to
elbow.
C.U. COFFEY -- He doesn't flinch. His eyes are hard and bright as diamond
drills. No one notices. He's keeping the edge.
LINDSEY
They're curious, maybe. We could be the first
people they've seen up close.
SONNY
Hope they don't judge the whole race offa us.
CATFISH
Maybe I oughta shave.
Coffey stands abruptly, snags Schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking
through the group as if they were smoke. This cold behavior brings the mood
down a notch.
INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE ROOM B 151
Outside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume.
Bright speculation, a few jokes. Coffey is visible shaking. Breathing hard.
Pupils dilated. Schoenick looks at him with concern.
COFFEY
It went straight for the warhead. And they
think it's cute.
SCHOENICK
You need to get some sleep.
Coffey walks away without hearing him. Schoenick catches up.
INT. MAINTENANCE 152
The door opens in the dark room. Coffey enters, moving with purpose. He
pulls his gear bag out from under the work table. Unzips it. Pulls out a
short-barreled CAR-15 assault rifle.
COFFEY
We have no way of warning the surface. Do you
know what that means?
Schoenick doesn't know. He hopes Coffey knows. Because he's a fearless man
who's discovering what it is to be afraid. Coffey inserts the magazine with
a CLACK! Snaps the bolt. Tosses the rifle to Schoenick.
COFFEY
It means... whatever happens is up to us.
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR/MAINTENANCE -- LATER 153
Hippy passes the maintenance room. Looks in. The warhead and its cart are
missing. He looks around. Heads toward the sub-bay.
INT. MESS HALL 154
The discussion, still in progress.
ONE NIGHT
You think they're from down there originally?
Or from... you know.
She jerks her thumb toward the ceiling.
LINDSEY
I think they're from 'you know'. Some place
that has similar conditions... cold, intense
pressure. No light.
CATFISH
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
INT. CORRIDOR/SUB BAY 155
Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from
the sub-bay. He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the
steel floor. Slides up along the wall next to the door. Inches his eye
around the doorframe. Across the room. Schoenick is working with a chainfall,
lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead, which is still on its cart. He
begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps.
Hippy lets his breath out slowly. His expression is Holy Shit.
He slides back along the corridor wall, silently. Away from the door. Then
turn turns quickly to go... WHAM! Coffey slams him up against the wall!
.45 pressed to Hippy's temple. Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the
hammer.
COFFEY
Sniff something did you, rat boy?
INT. MESS HALL 156
The meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy is thrusted
inside. His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face.
Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the .45. Schoenick flanks him
with the assault rifle aimed at the group.
COFFEY
FREEZE! Don't move. That's it.
(to Monk)
Here, hold this a second. We're going to phase
three.
He hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team
member. Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol. We can't tell what
he's thinking. Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair.
HIPPY
They're using Big Geek to take the bomb to the
NTIs! We set it up to go right to them.
Lindsey looks stricken. Her plan is betraying them all.
LINDSEY
Oh my God... Oh no...
(steps toward Coffey)
Please, you can't. Coffey, think about what
you're doing... for God's sake--
Coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering.
Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke
machine, pinning her there with one hand. Bud leaps forward.
SCHOENICK
GET BACK!
Bud freezes. The rifle's muzzle is aimed for a heart-shot.
Coffey moves up close to Lindsey.
COFFEY
This is something I've wanted to do since I
first met you.
His hand reaches down, OUT OF FRAME. We hear something RIP. His hand comes
back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape.
He slaps it over her mouth. Then pushes her down into a chair.
Hippy looks at Monk and Schoenick.
HIPPY
You boss is having a full-on meltdown. Guy's
fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and
we're all ringside!
MONK
What's the timer set for?
SCHOENICK
Three hours.
COFFEY
Shut up! Don't talk!
MONK
We can't get to minimum-safe-distance in three
hours. The shockwave will kill us. It'll crush
this rig like a semi driving over a beer can.
COFFEY
Shut up! SHUT UP! What's the matter with you?!
Everybody is twitching a hyper. Schoenick is white-knuckling his assault
rifle... looking from Monk to Coffey to the group.
COFFEY
Just stay calm. The situation is under control.
Coffey backs out quickly with Schoenick.
INT. CORRIDOR 157
Coffey dogs down the watertight door and wedges a piece of steel pipe into
the mechanism so it can't be opened.
COFFEY
Stay here.
Schoenick take a position in front of the door. Coffey turns and runs through
the corridor like demons are chasing him.
INT. MESS HALL 158
Their only hope is to sway Schoenick. But the SEAL's fear is making him the
perfect machine, totally dependent on external orders. And his orders are
clear. They can see him through the tiny window in the door. Lindsey rips
the tape painfully off her mouth.
LINDSEY
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make
a real bad career move...
HIPPY
That guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
BUD
We have to stop him! Schoenick!!
They pound on the door. Schoenick turns and hangs his cap over the tiny
window.
INT. SUB BAY 159
Using the chainfall, Coffey maneuvers the completed Geek/MIRV package over
the back of Flatbed, obviously preparing to use the submersible to take it
out and launch it.
INT. MESS HALL 160
Lindsey is up next to the door, with Bud.
LINDSEY
... he's about to declare war on an alien species,
Schoenick, just when they're trying to make
contact with us.
(to Bud)
I think I'm reaching him.
There is a CLUNK-CLATTER and the door unlatches.
LINDSEY
See?
The door opens. Jammer is standing there. Schoenick is in a heap against
the far wall, moaning. Jammer hands the rifle to Hippy as he walks in. Hippy
turns to cover the other SEAL. Monk puts his hands up, passively.
MONK
I'm the least of your problems.
Bud appraises Jammer, who seems a little weak and dazed but basically okay.
BUD
Thanks. How you feeling, big guy?
JAMMER
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that
angel comin' toward me.
They all look at him for a second. What?
BUD
Uh, okay, right. You can tell us about it
later. Let's go.
CUT TO:
INT. TRIMODULE C/LADDERWELL 161
Bud drops down the ladder, INTO FRAME, followed by the others. He tries the
door into the main corridor. The wheel won't turn. The others get on it.
Won't budge.
BUD
He's jammed the mechanism.
LINDSEY
Now what?
They're locked in trimodule-C. No other doors give access to the sub-bay
corridor. Bud's mind is racing. He drops down the ladder to Level One, into
about two feet of water. He reaches down and open the emergency lockout
hatch. Takes off his boots.
BUD
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get
inside, get the door open from the other side.
LINDSEY
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above
freezing.
BUD
Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?
Catfish is pulling his boots off as well.
CATFISH
Wish us luck.
(hands his wallet to Hippy)
'Case I don't die. Okay, Bud... let's go,
podner, I ain't got all day.
Bud clasps him on the shoulder and starts hyperventilating. He drops into
the water.
EXT. DEEPCORE/TRIMODULE C 162
Bed shoots down through the hatch. The cold hits him list a fist, becoming
instantly paralyzing. He starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark
water, maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel.
Catfish is behind him, swimming like hell. They reach hatch six. Together
they spin the wheel and heave upward, opening it.
INT. TRIMODULE D/LEVEL ONE 163
Bud surges up into the lock. Catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him.
They try the upper hatch. Jammed. They're both panting with the exertion
and intense cold.
BUD
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool. Only way.
CATFISH
I can't... make it... podner.
Bud looks at Catfish, shivering and heaving, wide-eyed.
BUD
Okay, Cat. You head back.
Bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch.
EXT. DEEPCORE 164
Bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit. He sees the
lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead.
INT. SUB BAY 165
In the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of
Flatbed. His wracked breathing is masked by the WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey
uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking
the Geek/MIRV in its gripper.
Bud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the
water onto the deck of the pool. He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle.
His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold. His fingers are
completely numb. He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits.
Scans the situation. He can't get to the door, which is across the room,
without Coffey seeing him.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 166
Lindsey watching the whole thing going down, ON THE SCREEN, a high angle of
the sub bay... Bud moving up on Coffey.
HIPPY
He can't get to the door... I think he's going
to try and take him himself.
LINDSEY
He couldn't be that dumb. The guy's a trained
killer. Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling
One Night over laundry duty.
ON THE SCREEN, Bud picks up a piece of pipe. Hefts it. Moves forward,
crouched... stalking. Lindsey yells at the screen in frustration.
LINDSEY
BUUUUUD!!
INT. SUB BAY 167
Bud chucks a tool across the chamber, creating a clattering distraction, then
wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of Coffey's knees,
taking him down. Coffey spins even as he falls, catching Bud in a scissor
kick that topples him.
Grappling, they fall together into the freezing water.
Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself
out, hoping to make it to the door.
Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs.
He pulls himself up as Bud kick out. Claws his way viciously over Bud's
body until he has him pinned to the deck. Then he pulls out the .45.
Put it unceremoniously to Bud's forehead.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 168
LINDSEY
NOOO!!
INT. SUB BAY 169
Coffey pulls the trigger... CLICK. Bud flinches, then opens his eyes,
staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the .45. Coffey cocks it and tries
again. CLICK. Nothing. Really pissed off beyond description, Bud hurls
the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against
a rack of equipment. They face off, panting.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 170
The rig crew turns from the screen at the sound of Monk's voice.
MONK
I tool the liberty of removing this before I
gave it back to him.
Monk pulls his hand out from under his blanket and holds up the magazine from
the .45.
INT. SUB WAY 171
Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked. Coffey's really trying to put him out
of business. It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part. Throw a few things.
When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard. Give him credit, though. He
manages to scramble back up.
The fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear.
Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor.
Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks.
Slams the SEAL's head in an equipment locker door.
But the Navy man is just too massive. Bud is hammered back into a wall.
Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace. Spins around at the
sound of a VOICE.
CATFISH
Hey!
Catfish is right behind him. Dripping wet. A trail of water goes back to
the moonpool a few feet away.
CRACK! Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is
knocked right on his ass. He doesn't get up. Just sort of flops around.
Catfish helps Bud to his feet. They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles
sideways, his eyes rabid.
He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them. As they duck he sprints to
Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down.
BUD
(to Catfish)
Get the door!
Bud leaps across the water to land on Flatbed. The hatch is already sealed.
He grapples with Geek/MIRV, trying to free it from the steel claw.
INT. FLATBED 172
Coffey crawls along the access tunnel to the pilot's compartment. He claws
his way into the control seat and starts rapidly flipping switches.
INT. CORRIDOR 173
Catfish pounds down the corridor like he's never run before, his beer gut
doing a rumba. He reaches the door, tears out the piece of pipe and spins
the wheel. Hippy pushes it open so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach.
Hippy tears past him, running with the assault rifle. John Wayne.
INT. SUB-BAY 174
Flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water. Bud
is being dragged down, still trying to free the ROV. He gives up when he
sees Hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo.
Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool.
Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey, visible inside his
viewing bubble beneath the swirling water. Coffey looks up, stares at the
gun... doesn't seem to care.
CATFISH
SHOOT!
Hippy's squeezing the trigger and nothing's happening. Flatbed's hatch tower
goes under.
CATFISH
Safety's on! On the side... the lever! Up,
push it up!
Hippy fumble with the selective-fire lever, BLAM-BLAM-BLAM! He put three
quick rounds into the ceiling.
HIPPY
SHIT!
CATFISH
Give me that!!
He grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub. He racks the water
with a long burst. BENEATH THE SURFACE, the rounds nip nasty contrails
through the water. They barely scar the front port.
LINDSEY
Forget that... go for Big Geek!
Catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the
shimmering shape of the ROV on its back. UNDERWATER we see the rounds
arcing wild, a few hitting the ROV but causing little damage.
Coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor. ABOVE, Catfish
empties the weapon.
BUD
Gimme a hand!
They all turn. Bud is fumbling into his wetsuit like a madman. The others
rush over to help him.
BUD
Get the rest of my gear. Grab that hat there...
let's go guys! Come on, come on!
Catfish slams a backpack onto Bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and
hose connections. Hippy and Sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and
buckling all over him. This is a world-record suit-up time. Bud pulls the
rubber neck-dam of the helmet's lower ring down over his face.
BUD
Helmet... helmet! Work fast.
EXT. DEEPCORE UNDERSTRUCTURE 175
Beneath the habitat, Coffey is maneuvering Flatbed through the twisted pipe
and debris left by Deepcore's slide to the edge. Bloodied, his fatigues
ripped half-off, he looks like a feral animal. His eyes burn with the
determination of his mission.
INT. SUB BAY 176
Jammer expertly works the crane controls, moving Cab One out over the
moonpool from its drydock cradle. Lindsey and One Night are scrambling like
monkeys over the port side crash bars of the swinging sub, clambering up to
the hatch tower.
ONE NIGHT
I'll unhook.
(Lindsey hesitates)
GO! You're better in these than I am.
Lindsey recognizes this for what it is... a sign of respect, a
reconciliation. She nods and drops through the hatch.
EXT. DEEPCORE 177
Coffey passes under the twisted wreckage of the big automated derrick and makes
a tight turn beneath the drill-floor module. Flatbed scrapes through between
twisted conduit, metal screeching on metal.
INT. SUB BAY 178
Bud has his 'hat' locked down and his air cut on. He take two quick strides
to the edge of the pool and just drops in.
EXT. DEEPCORE 179
Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles. He looks around. Through
the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from
its exit point under the stern. Bud see a shortcut under the platform.
He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over-
hand stokes. He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.
Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing
behind it. He is jerked along behind the sub.
Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful
thrusters. Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal
wall. The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure. He pulls
himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.
LOW ANGLE, look up the wall. Flatbed appears over the edge and stops.
Hovering.
ON THE BACK OF FLATBED. Bud has the break he needs. He scrambles up onto the
deck and opens and equipment locker. Nothing in it but one of the yellow
nylon safety lines. The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.
INT./EXT. FLATBED 180
Coffey works intently. His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a
face streaked with blood. He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.
GEEK/ROV had a passenger. Brigman. The diver is holding Geek's skid with
one hand, doing something with the other. He turns to look at Coffey.
EXT. FLATBED/DEEPCORE 181
Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the
steel claw. Bud dives. The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow. Bud
kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out. We see he has managed to tie
one end to Geek's skids. Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending
an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder. The little robot, pregnant with its
load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.
Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud. Bud strokes rapidly to a large
jumble of wreckage. He loops the rope around a twisted pipe. Big Geek is
hauling ass away from him. The line snap taut an instant later. The ROV
strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go. The rope is slipping
as Bud fights to make a knot.
Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining. As it banks, it hurls up clouds of
sediment from the escarpment face.
Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.
The big arm extends menacingly. The smaller from manipulators open. An
enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.
The big machine roars forward. Straight at Bud.
Bud gets his knot partly done. See Flatbed looming.
Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as
Coffey closes the last few feet.
One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside
rakes across his legs as it passes over. Flatbed crushes into the tangle of
pipework. K-CRUUUNCH!!
INT. FLATBED 182
Coffey is slammed hard over the controls, up into the front dome port. He
gets back in the seat. Strains to free his machine.
EXT. DEEPCORE/BIG GEEK/FLATBED 183
Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in
Coffey's blind area. Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris.
It pivots toward Bud. Moves after him.
Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please. Trying to GO.
DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip. The nylon
line starts to play through the knot slowly.
BUD has gotten himself into a bad position. Along the bare rock face of the
cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a
truck. Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward.
Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic. There's no cover, side to
side, up or down.
Coffey has him head in his lights. Suddenly a bright glare blasts in,
blinding Coffey. He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full
throttle.
At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible
slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab. Coffey is
smashed sideways by the shock. He fights to control his vehicle. Lindsey
looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight. She
cruises up over Bud.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
Get in!
Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly.
INT./EXT. CAB ONE 184
Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut. He ditches his helmet.
Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall. Through the front port
there is not sign of Coffey.
LINDSEY
You owe me one, Virgil.
BUD
Can we negotiate later? There's Big Geek.
He points. Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at
its leash. Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to
open her own small manipulator claws.
EXT. DEEPCORE/WALL, ETC. 185
The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot.
Big Geek happily surges forward. It dives gracefully down into the void,
trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail.
ONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port.
BUD
Go after it! We gotta catch it!
FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One. They are
slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them. She hits full
throttle. Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his
more powerful vehicle. With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.
She arcs back toward the rig. Flatbed slams her again, for the side. She
fights for control.
INT./EXT. CAB ONE 186
Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls. Lindsey flies with her
jaw set. Fighting hard for control. The A-frame of the rig looms before her.
She shoots through at full throttle.
EXT. DEEPCORE AND OCEAN TERRAIN 187
Now the fight is really on. The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical
modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls.
Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways. It screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules.
They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.
Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash. Lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.
Lindsey snarls. He's pissing her off. He shouldn't do that.
Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.
Lindsey rises, cuts right.
Smashes down into Coffey's craft. Timing it just right. He skids catch in
the rocks.
Flatbed slews violently, nosing down. Crushing into the rocky bottom.
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.
It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.
Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the
wall. With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds
her crippled sub. Flatbed tumbles over the edge.
ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's
tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.
INT. FLATBED 188
Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control.
He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge. As the
pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with
the enormous load.
A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble. Grows.
Coffey gives up fighting. Just stares, wide eyed, at his death. A damned
soul dropping into the bottomless pit.
The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port.
Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes
into him. A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a
bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards.
EXT. CANYON WALL 189
Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall.
Soon its lights vanish.
INT. CAB ONE 190
They're both going to have a lot of bruises...
Lindsey is surveying the damage. Water is spraying down on them like a
shower, and lights are flickering.
LINDSEY
You did okay, back there. I was fairly
impressed.
BUD
Not good enough. We still gotta catch Big Geek.
LINDSEY
Not in this thing.
Lindsey is flipping switches. Nothing works.
BUD
You totaled it, huh?
LINDSEY
Yeah. So sue me.
Bud looks down. There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the
floor at their feet.
BUD
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
LINDSEY
You noticed.
She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone.
LINDSEY
Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.
She waits. No response.
BUD
Try again.
LINDSEY
Deepcore, this is Cab One. We need assistance,
over. Deepcore, this--
With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything
goes black.
LINDSEY
Well, that's that.
BUD
Wonderful.
(looking around)
There's some light from somewhere...
A faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port.
Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.
LINDSEY
Over there. It's the rig.
A glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the
hill in the desert.
BUD
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
LINDSEY
They'll come out after us.
BUD
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find
us. We better get this flooding stopped.
He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light. Using the thing like a bulky
flashlight. The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower...
almost two feet deep already.
LINDSEY
You see where it's coming in?
BUD
Somewhere behind this panel. Hold this.
She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by
a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.
BUD
Can't get to it. Have to pull this panel off.
You go any tools?
LINDSEY
I don't know, look around.
Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water. It's past his
knees.
BUD
Nothing. Son of a bitch. All I need's a goddamn
crescent wrench.
He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench
it off the wall. Heaves on it repeatedly. Finally stops, panting. He's
breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.
BUD
Son of a bitch!
LINDSEY
Calm down, Bud.
A nervous edge in her voice now. Bud's turning all around, looking around
for anything, trying to think fast. Water up to their waists. The sea
closing in.
BUD
Okay... okay. We gotta get you out of here.
LINDSEY
How?
BUD
I don't know how!
LINDSEY
We've only got one suit.
BUD
I know! I know! But we better come up with
something.
LINDSEY
Aaargh!! I'm freezing!
She climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling,
keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water. She's
shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water
pouring in.
LINDSEY
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back
with another suit.
BUD
Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough
time. Look at this...
(the rate of flooding)
Time I get back you'll be--
That stops the conversation for a second. About two feet of airspace left.
Bud can't believe what this is coming down to. They both stare at each other
for a long moment.
He makes a decision. Starts pulling off his backpack.
BUD
Alright, put this on.
LINDSEY
What, you growing gills all of a sudden? You
got it on, keep it on.
BUD
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
LINDSEY
No way! Forget it. Not an option.
Bud has his pack off uncoupling it. She keeps fighting his hands, stopping
him, hooking it back up. The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.
BUD
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
LINDSEY
NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're--
BUD
FUCK LOGIC!!
They're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests.
Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.
LINDSEY
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!?
You're for the suit on and you're a better
swimmer than me. Right? So I got a plan...
BUD
What's the plan?
LINDSEY
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
BUD
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
Lindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide. But she's keeping
it together. Thinking it out. Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her
and he can barely think.
LINDSEY
Look, this water is only a couple degrees above
freezing. I drown. I go into deep hypothermia...
my blood like icewater. I can maybe be revived
after ten, fifteen minutes. You got all the
stuff to do it on the rig.
Bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him. The water is up
to their necks. He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right.
BUD
It is insane.
LINDSEY
It's the only way, Bud. Now trust me.
She takes a deep breath. Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his
suit, rehooking everything.
BUD
Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.
She raise his helmet. Water up to their chins. They lock eyes, inches
apart. He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.
BUD
Oh God, Lins... I--
LINDSEY
Tell me later.
He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his. They lock
together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked
realization of love hanging over the abyss of death.
She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet
over his head. Seats is down over the neck ring. Lock the bail-out handle,
sealing it. Even with her head press up into the highest point of the
ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water. She give a scared little
laugh.
LINDSEY
This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?
She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically. Puts her face to
the glass of his helmet. Seconds to go.
LINDSEY
Hold me. Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...
He can't hear her, but he read her lips. They clutch each other desperately.
The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose. She starts
to choke. Her hands grip his shoulders like claws. She bucks and thrashes.
Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.
BUD
NOOOOO!!!
The freezing seawater races into her lungs. Her finger go slack, and her
hands float lifelessly.
Bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open
mouth. He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of
the lockout hatch.
CUT TO:
INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE 191
TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, one of the outside cameras. A ghostly figure swims out
of the darkness, towing something.
ONE NIGHT
It's Bud. Oh my God... that's Lindsey!
BUD (V.O./faint)
Deepcore, Deepcore, do you read?
HIPPY
Read you, Bud. We're here.
EXT. DEEPCORE 192
Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey. Her arms and legs float
as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current. Bud's voice comes in
short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.
BUD
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...
de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc
syringe... and some... heating blankets.
You got all that?
HIPPY (V.O.)
Got it. Over.
BUD
Meet me in the moonpool. Move fast.
INT. INFIRMARY 193
The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in. He picks up the CPR cart, meant
to roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who
are crowding in to get the rest of the equipment. They ransack the place in
about ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything
else.
EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER THE MOONPOOL 194
Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving
platform. Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge,
looking down.
INT. SUB-BAY 195
Hippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit, dropping things,
making mistakes. One Night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a
bottle of adrenaline.
SONNY
Here he comes!
Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged
diving platform. Bud bursts to the surface. Together they haul Lindsey
across the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck. Her skin is blue-
white, her chest still.
Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a
mission. The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see
Lindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert. Water flows from her mouth and
nose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp. Hippy peels back one
eyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated.
But when Bud shouts for them to move, they move.
BUD
Turn her over!
They flip his wife's body over. He straddles her, pushing down with both
hands in the middle of her back. Seawater gushes from her slack lips. He
does it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back.
BUD
Come on, hurry! Gimme the de-fib...
One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment. They've
all been trained in CPR and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a
friend they're working on. They're all thumbs. Catfish drops the electrodes,
picks them up quickly, hands them to Bud...
CATFISH
Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare
skin, or it won't...
Bud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her
T-shirt, revealing her bare chest... bony and still.
BUD
Jesus. Gimme those, come on. Catfish, move it,
man! Come on... come on!
He slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on
the side of the rib cage.
BUD
Is that it? Is this right?
HIPPY
Yeah! I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
BUD
All right. Do it!
One Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses. It is a pure muscle
reflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life. Hippy pushes him
back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth. He opens the valve
on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag. They start packing
electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia
BUD
Do it again, One Night. Zap her again!
The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches. Bud doesn't wait for a
result... he's in his own reality now, driven. He's doing it all at once,
somehow, in a senseless frenzy... pumping on her chest with his hands,
squeezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes.
BUD
Aw. Christ... come on, baby. Again! Do it
again!
Lindsey's back arches. Her body relaxes, inert.
BUD
Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?
A hush seems to have fallen over the group. They know instinctively that it's
over. But Bud can't accept it. He looks at them, beseechingly, like they
are somehow intentionally holding out on him. One Night starts to cry,
quietly.
CATFISH
(gently)
Bud, it's over, man. It's over.
There is a beat of silence. Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open,
motionless eyes.
TIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving in until the pupil FILLS FRAME, a black void.
REVERSE, HER POV. SILENCE. A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One
Night, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down. It is like the circular top of
a dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water. It is
as if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing
smaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes
a point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a
turned-off TV.
TIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring. Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder.
Suddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman,
renewing his efforts in spades... totally manic.
BUD
No! NO! She's not... her heart is strong,
she wants to live... can't you see that? Come
on, Lins. Come on, baby! Zap her again! Do
it... DO IT!
They do. And Bud works, feverishly. He lock his lips over hers and starts
mouth-to-mouth. It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life.
BUD
Come on, breath! Goddamn it, you bitch, you
never backed down from anything in life... now
fight!
He slaps her face, hard. Her head lolls. He smacks her the other way.
BUD
Fight, Goddamnit!
LINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well. The circles of faces and
light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit. We
see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike.
BUD
FIGHT!!
TIGHT ON LINDSEY, still. Then something incredible happens. Something they
will never forget as long as they live. Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her
hands clench in a spasm.
Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific.
BUD
Come on, Lins. You can do it... fight your
way back, baby...
The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.
She starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air
into her lungs. Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re-
establish circulation. It is like a difficult birth. Lindsey comes hacking
and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.
Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized
breath. He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands,
and watches her breathe. Color is returning to her skin as she lies there,
gasping weakly.
ONE THE GROUP... Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others... they're
all grinning, crying, beaming... gazing at the miracle of her rebirth.
ON BUD... tears are streaming down his face.
BUD
(a whisper, fierce and harsh)
You did it, ace.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. DEEPCORE/QUARTERS -- LATER 196
TIGHT ON LINDSEY, sleeping peacefully. WIDER shows Bud hovering over her,
attentive. They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle. Perhaps twenty minutes
have passed. She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face,
and looks like a waif.
Lindsey's eyes flutter and open. The first thing she sees is Bud, bending
over her. He can't help himself. The tears break again and roll down his
cheeks. She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware. She smiles,
faintly... touches his cheek.
LINDSEY
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
BUD
Hi, lady.
LINDSEY
Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
BUD
'Course is worked. You're never wrong, are you?
How d'you feel.
LINDSEY
I've been better. Next time it's your turn,
okay?
Bud's expression turn inexplicably grim.
BUD
Well, you got that right.
CUT TO:
INT. SUB-BAY 197
TIGHT ON BUD'S EYES, as Monk's fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his
eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet.
WIDER reveals Bud is wearing the SEALs' deep suit. Everybody is grouped
around, buckling and zipping. He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask,
part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing. Monk,
on his stretcher, is presiding. The resident expert. Lindsey is wrapped in a
blanket, still looking wan and frail. She doesn't have the strength to resist
Bud's will, but she's trying.
LINDSEY
No, Bud, no... not you.
BUD
Who then?
She looks around at the others. Sees their eyes. The fear. Has her answer.
He lowers the helmet over his head. Catfish clamps it down. We see what's
driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being
able to prevent this situation.
He touches her cheek, one last time. She sees his fingers are trembling.
Then he puts on the gloves. Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's
forearm. Lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness.
BUD (muffled)
So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?
MONK
The fluid prevents your larynx from making
sound. It'll feel a little strange.
BUD (muffled)
Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist.
(a beat)
The moment of truth, huh?
His breathing is shallow and tense. He looks at Lindsey. The eyes of a
condemned man. She squeezes his hand. He takes a deep breath.
BUD
Okay. Let's rock and roll.
Monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line. The breathing fluid (3M
fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into the helmet. Bud reflexively raises
his chin. The liquid fills toward his mouth.
MONK
Relax now, Bud. Just keep breathing as it
fills... don't fight it. Take it in. Just let
yourself take it in.
Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid. His eyes go wide,
instant panic. He starts to thrash. Chest heaving.
MONK
Hold him. Hold him. This is normal... it'll
pass in a second. You're gonna be okay. We all
breathe liquid for nine months, Bud. Your body
will remember.
Lindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him. He finds her eyes, the look
calming him. He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned.
His spasms subside. He begins to ""breathe"" normally. He gets a goofy look
of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing. He is
alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet. He grins.
Gives a big thumbs up. Lindsey picks up a microphone.
LINDSEY
Can you hear me okay?
(another thumbs up)
Try your keypad.
Bud taps out a brief message. FEELS WEIRD - YOU SHOULD TRY THIS prints out
on their portable monitor.
LINDSEY
I already have, moron.
They help Bud to the edge of the dive platform. Jammer and Hippy lower Little
Geek into the water and Bud grabs onto it. Hippy yells right up next to his
helmet.
HIPPY
I redid Little Geek's chip the same as Big Geek!
He should take you right to it. All you gotta
do is hang on!
Lindsey crouches at the edge to watch Bud submerge.
He looks up at her as he drops away.
In a few seconds, she can't see him. Her chin quivers, minutely.
EXT. DEEPCORE/THE WALL 198
FROM FAR BELOW, Deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness.
A single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts
down. It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall.
He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down.
Bud looks down. Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the
glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness. The wall
unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery. He looks
up. The lights of Deepcore are gone. He feels more alone than he has ever
felt. He types out: CANT SEE YOU
LINDSEY (V.O.)
We're right here with you, Bud. Your depth is
3800 feet. You're doing fine.
Bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane, hanging against the wall
like a forty-ton yo-yo at the end of the umbilical.
INT. COMMAND MODULE 199
Everyone is grouped around the monitor screen, watching Bud's telemetry. Bud
types out: GOOD DEAL ON SLIGHTLY USED CRANE. They watch the depth meter
counting down.
MONK
4800 feet. It's official.
LINDSEY
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record
for the deepest suit dive. Bet you didn't think
you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
The screen print out: CALL GUINESS. They laugh. So far so good. Seconds
later...
HIPPY
One mile down and still grinnin'.
EXT. THE WALL 200
WIDE SHOT. Bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little
pool of light. The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth.
LOOKING DOWN, as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness
yawning below.
INT. COMMAND MODULE 201
Lindsey has the microphone gripped tightly, and the lightness in her voice is
a bit brittle.
LINDSEY
8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay?
MONK
Ask him a pressure effects. Tremors, vision
problems, euphoria.
LINDSEY
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
ON THE SCREEN, printing out: COLD.
LINDSEY
Big baby.
Then: HANDS SHAKING. HHARD TO TYPE.
MONK
It's starting. It hits the nervous system
first.
ONE NIGHT
Keep talking, Lindsey. Just let him hear your
voice. It doesn't matter what about.
LINDSEY
Don't forget Bud, you're being graded on spelling
as well as sentence structure, so concentrate,
okay?
(long pause)
Bud, I... uh, there's some things I want to say.
It's hard for me. I'm not of those softy, gooey-
center-type people. It's not easy, you know,
being a cast-iron bitch. It takes discipline
and years of training. A lot of people don't
appreciate that.
Lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room. In her mind she is
with Bud, out in the darkness.
LINDSEY
But is wasn't all bad. I know that. You
remember that bike trip... we rode the Honda
up through Oregon? It took me a week to get my
hair untangled, but I've never been happier. It
was the most... free... I've ever felt. I'm
sorry I can't tell you these things to your face.
EXT. THE WALL 202
Bud is visibly trembling, gritting his teeth... holding on as the vise-grip
of pressure takes him.
LINDSEY (V.O./filtered)
It's pitiful. I have to wait until you're
freezing in the dark and there's ten thousand
feet of water between us. I guess I'm babbling.
I'm sorry.
Bud struggles with his keyboard.
INT. COMMAND MODULE 203
ON THE SCREEN: YOU ALWAYS DID TALK TOO MUCH
Somehow's she's smiling and on the verge of tears at the same time.
HIPPY
Two miles down and still grinnin' Comin' up on
the big ten thou'.
ONE NIGHT
Bottom's still a mile and a half down.
EXT. THE ABYSS 204
BLAM! Bud jerks as his dive light implodes. He still has Geek's floodlights.
He falls on.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 205
HIPPY
12000 feet. Jesus, I don't believe he's doing
this.
LINDSEY
Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing?
He types: SE LUMINUS THINNGS
Everyone snaps suddenly alert.
HIPPY
Uh, oh...
LINDSEY
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
CATFISH
Maybe it's... you know... them.
The screen prints out: ITS OK. SQUID. GLOWING SQUID.
EXT. THE ABYSS 206
Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated
creatures less than a foot long. Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs
around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see. He stares at
them in wonder. Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go. Are
they really here? He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 207
Another message from Bud: THINK THEYR REAL.
MONK
He's losing it. Talk to him. Keep him with us.
LINDSEY
Bud, it's the pressure. Try to concentrate.
Concentrate on my voice. Just listen to my voice.
EXT. THE ABYSS 208
Bud emerges from the school of squid. As he falls, they form a luminous plane
of swirling colors above him. He stares upwards, transfixed. BUD'S POV, the
ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him. A spectral form takes shape in
the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide.
Gazing down at him, her expression sad. Her image receded away from him into
the darkness above as he falls.
DOWN ANGLE ON BUD, reaching up in anguish.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 209
Lindsey watches as Bud haltingly types out: YOUR GOING AWAY
LINDSEY
I'm not going away, Bud. I'm right here, right
here with you. This is Lindsey, Bud. I'm right
here.
ONE NIGHT
Signal's fading.
HIPPY
We're losing juice... kill everything we don't
need. Catfish, knock out those lights.
Everyone hustles to comply. The room is plunged into darkness, the faces of
the group lit only by the ghostly CRT screen.
ONE NIGHT
Run it through the digital processor, cook it as
much as you can.
CATFISH
Seventeen thousand feet. Good Christ Almighty,
this is insane.
EXT. THE ABYSS 210
Bud is shaking violently, as if with palsy. His eyes keep rolling back, and
he's having a hard time staying conscious. He tries to type a message and he
can't. The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous
system. Suddenly K-BAM! Little Geek's pressure hull implodes. Its lights
go out. BLACKNESS.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 211
ONE NIGHT
Little Geek just folded.
HIPPY
Bye, little buddy.
MONK
He can still make it.
LINDSEY
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that
cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark
with you, Bud you're not alone...
Lindsey seems not to be in the room, but to be with him, seeing what he sees.
She is oblivious to the others.
EXT. THE ABYSS 212
Blackness. Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE.
It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge. Bud discards the stalwart
little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute. Out of control, he
hits a ledge and rolls off. Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris. He hits
another outcropping, limp as a rag doll. Rocks and sand rain down with him
as he continues his descent.
Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor.
He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position.
In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to
the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of
air and light. Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
You remember that time, you were pretty drunk,
you probably don't remember... the power went
out at the old apartment, the one on Orange
Street... and we were staring at that one little
candle, and I said something really dumb like
that candle is me, like every one of us is out
there alone in the dark in this life...
INT. CONTROL MODULE 213
TIGHT ON LINDSEY as she grips the microphone. Her voice has become a hoarse
whisper. Her eyes are intense, focused on a point far beyond the walls of the
room.
LINDSEY
... and you lit another candle and put it beside
mine and said ""that's me""... and we stared at
the two candles, and then we... well, if you
remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the
next part. Bud, there are two candles in the
dark. I'm with you. I'll always be with you.
EXT. THE ABYSS 214
A tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall. Bud falls on in
dream-like solitude, a candle in the dark.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 215
Catfish gently takes the microphone from Lindsey's hands and leans close.
CATFISH
How you doin', podner? Still with us, come-back?
Talk to us, Buddy boy.
They watch the screen, expectantly.
Nothing. Hippy and One Night start checking the equipment. Lindsey tried
unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here voice.
LINDSEY
Bud? You hangin' in there? Talk to me, Bud.
Are you okay?
There is an agonizing pause, then the letters appear slowly: SHAKING STOPED.
FEEL BETER. SOM LITE BELOW.
LINDSEY
What kind of light?
LIGHT EVYWHER. BEAWTIFULLL
MONK
He's hallucinating badly.
EXT. THE ABYSS 216
Bud is no longer in pain. His expression is rapt.
LOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape. His last flare sputters out,
but there is light. Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon
below him. And he's right... it is beautiful.
The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted
figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels. Barren as
the moon but exquisite, serene. Changeless. A place unseen by human eyes.
Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible. Bud descends toward
the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf. Below the shelf, the wall
slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it.
ONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit. Bud's feet thump into the
sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles. Touchdown... three and
half miles of water over his head. Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of
fireflies.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 217
AT GEEK prints out. Monk takes the headset gently from Lindsey.
MONK
Okay, Bud, we'll go step by step. Take the
cover plate off the firing box.
A long pause. Then... PLATE OFF
MONK
All right, Bud, you have to cut the ground wire,
not the lead wire...
EXT. ABYSSAL LEDGE 218
Bud is peering into the detonator unit. How bad is he? We can't tell.
MONK (V.O.)
It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not...
I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow
stripe.
Bud is staring. Blinking. The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're
miles away... way down there where his hands are.
The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK. He pulls out the little
plastic tube. Breaks and shakes. It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green
light. He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters.
CUTING NNOW he types to them. He reaches into the detonator.
DETAIL, THE WIRES... in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical. The
cutters go over on wire. A long beat. They withdraw, then go over the other
wire...
He cuts--
INT. CONTROL MODULE 219
Everyone is frozen. Waiting. It's very quiet.
LINDSEY
Would we see the flash?
MONK
Through three miles of water? I don't know.
They're holding their breaths. Then... STILL HERE
A cheer goes up. Rebel yells.
CATFISH
Quiet, quiet! Save you air, goddamnit.
MONK
Bud, give me a reading off you liquid oxygen
gauge.
TEN MINUTES WORTH ID SAY. Lindsey does white.
HIPPY
It took him over an hour to get down there--
It's hopeless. Lindsey grabs the headset from Monk.
LINDSEY
Drop you weights and start back now! The gauge
could be wrong...
EXT. ABYSSAL LEDGE 220
Bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead. His expression is enigmatic.
He looks around slowly at the luminous canyon. Starts to type.
INT. CONTROL MODULE 221
The message comes in: NO. THINK ILL STAY A WHILE. BEAUTIFUL HERE. WORTH
ADMISSION
LINDSEY
No! You can make it! You hear me? Drop your
weights... you... can breathe shallow... you...
it could be wrong--
Lindsey's voice has twisted into a sob. She begins to weep, quietly.
LINDSEY
Oh God, Virgil, please...
DONT CRY BABY
A pause. Then the words...
WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON. BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.
Lindsey sobs at the mike. The others look away. The signal is weakening.
One Night boosts it and the screen clears briefly.
LOVE YOU WIFE.
She stares at the printout.
LINDSEY
Love you.
There is no reply.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE ABYSS 222
A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his
horse in the desert.
Bud's eyelids close. His chest barely moving.
A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open. He blinks. Weakly,
he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.
BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision. It seems to
be an angel. Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish. Its body
and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass. A
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates
gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer. The
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a
cold, dispassionate wisdom.
It is stunningly beautiful.
The creature settles toward him. Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.
Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove. It pulls him up from
the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the
abyss.
At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below. They
resolve into NTI ships. Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey
nearly collided with at the Montana wreck. The larger manta-ships. And
others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.
Suddenly the darkness explodes with light. A vast, reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below
them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench. It sweeps outward from the
center, as if the light were surging through channels. The NTIs are revealing
their home to Bud. The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a
major city.
EXT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE 223
Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark
surface of inhuman design. The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility.
Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface. It
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon
yawns like a vast mouth.
They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth-
like opening.
INT. N.T.I. STRUCTURE 224
Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him. It is a
curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system,
where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional
space. Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet
across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.
INT. FINAL CHAMBER 225
Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a
few feet.
A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the
chamber. The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls.
They move apart. Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.
Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free. Drops to his knees.
Doubles over as spasms wrack him. Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs.
He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what
he can only hope is air. It is.
Bud slowly recovers, sitting up. His head is clearing. This really is
happening. Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the
NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven
is gathered watching him.
BUD
Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?
His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber. Soft laps of water
from the 'walls'.
In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be
circuit diagrams. Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in
mid-air. The image is about twenty feet across.
There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into...
the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news. STATIC, then another
newscast. And another. Fragments of the same story. The world on the brink
of war.
BUD
You watch out TV? That what you're trying to
say? That you know what's been going on up
there?
The NTIs are impassive. Static... then another newscast.
This time, we're allowed to focus on the story. An on-the-scene interview
outside a high-tech seismology lab. There is an air of hysteria about the
scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people
shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist.
REPORTER
... a Caltech scientist who is among those
reporting an unprecedented disturbance in the
world's oceans. Dr. Breg, can you give us a
clearer explanation then we're getting?
Berg is edgy and distracted. People keeps handing him pieces of paper,
computer hardcopy. The biggest thing in his life is happening...
BERG
They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but
with no seismological source. The waves are
propagating toward the shorelines of every
continent--
An assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning. We see that Berg is
running scared. The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational
mind.
BERG
Yeah. I'll be right there... I have to go.
Look, we don't know what it is! Okay? Not the
slightest goddamn idea!
The image dissolves into static, fades out. Bud turns to the NTIs.
BUD
You're doing it! Right? That's what you're
telling me. Yeah, you can control water...
that's your technology. But why?
Static again, then a brilliant flash. Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb
test in the Pacific.
The film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an
unbroken white glare. Bud gets the message.
BUD
Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it.
Where do you get off passing judgment on us,
when you can't be sure? How do you know?
The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments
from recent history...
US soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in
Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and
bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at
Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old
contra with an AK-47... Just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each.
But enough. The images continue.
HOLD ON BUD, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of
humanity.
CUT TO:
EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA -- DAY 226
A video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and
runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean. Pandemonium reigns around
them, people running, driving, evacuating inland.
On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared.
It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the
horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing.
EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY 227
LONG LENSE SHOT, looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the
Verazzano Narrows. Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of
water impossibly high, still miles out.
EXT. NAVAL BASE, KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT 228
The scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia,
where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave.
SIRENS wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base.
Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and
growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion.
EXT. OCEAN FRONT, SANTA MONICA -- DAY 229
The minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his
voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg
disaster.
REPORTER
The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting
to run... some are just staring, unable to
move... the wave... the wave is... it's...
I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high
already... getting bigger as I'm watching...
still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can
hear it...
A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even
the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard. They
leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward
and upward as the ground begins to shake.
EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY 230
The Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is
blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall.
EXT. SAN FRANSISCO -- DAY 231
LONG LENS SHOT -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the
buildings downtown. Beyond, FILLING FRAME is the wall of sea green which
defies our comprehension. The image shakes with the THUNDER.
EXT. MALIBU -- DAY 232
A diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which
transcends his worst nightmare. He lies paralyzed on his board.
EXT. MIAMI -- DAY 233
Downtown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith.
In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him,
blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over,
about to break upon the teeming city.
And then...
The wave slows as it crests...
And stops.
IT SIMPLY STOPS.
2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its
surface in the bright sun. There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of
confused gulls. Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover,
only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation. A news
helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly.
EXT. MALIBU 234
The surfer just blinks, starting.
EXT. NEW YORK -- DAY 235
On the East Coast it's the same, as the World Trade Centers are dwarfed by a
shimmering blue wall which stands... waiting.
EXT. PETROPAVLOVSK NAVAL BASE, U.S.S.R. -- NIGHT 236
Russian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the
Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the
moonlight. It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable
devastation... but it doesn't.
EXT. OCEAN FRONT WALK, SANTA MONICA 237
When all have seen...
The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface
of the sea is normal again.
VIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea. Moving from
face to face. Various reactions as people respond to what they can only
understand as a miracle. The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked...
laughing. The cameraman is just walking. Some people turn to him and smile,
or laugh, or whoop.
A woman is collapsed on a bench, crying.
A man is on his knees, shaking.
Total strangers hug each other.
A black guy, tears pouring down his face, turns to the camera with a beautific
grin.
GUY
Somebody just laid it down to us, man. Things
ain't never gonna be the same!
PULL BACK to reveal that we are in the...
INT. FINAL CHAMBER 238
Bud sits, shaken, watching the screen, as people react to their deliverance.
He turns to the NTIs.
BUD
Why? You could've done it. Why didn't you?
The screen darkens. Then letters appears on it, slowly printing out, as if
someone was clumsily typing them.
WE KNEW THIS WAS...
And we've seen this before so we know the rest...
WE KNEW THIS WAS A ONE WAY TICKET WHEN I PUT THIS THING ON. BUT YOU KNOW I
HAD TO COME.
A pause, then:
LOVE YOU WIFE
The last message expands to fill the entire screen.
Bud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the
aliens. They bow their heads, just for a moment. A sign of respect.
CLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened.
CUT TO:
INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE 239
Lindsey is slumped in a chair, just staring. Withdrawn.
The others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark.
The air is looking pretty thick. The speaker of the hydrophone transceiver
crackles to life.
MCBRIDE (V.O.)
Deepcore, do you read? This is Benthic Explorer,
over.
CATFISH
Hell yes, we read! Good of you to join us. How's
that storm doin'?
MCBRIDE
Well, it's strange... it just kind've blew
itself out all of the sudden. We're up here in
a flat sea with no wind. But then a lot of weird
things've been happening.
CATFISH
Well, hell, son. You better get us a line down
here, we're in moderately poor shape.
LATER, Hippy, Catfish, and Monk are conferring B.G. on how to get a new
umbilical hooked on. One Night is talking to McBride on the hydrophone.
MCBRIDE
They figure is was over a half mile high.
ONE NIGHT
I wish I could have seen it--
She glances down at the telemetry screen, seeing movement.
ONE NIGHT
Hey. Hey! HEY!! Look... it's Bud.
MONK
That's impossible.
Lindsey bolts to the screen. Stares at the message printing out.
A huge grin wraps around her face.
LINDSEY
No it's not.
MCBRIDE (V.O.)
What's it say?
Lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen. During the message, her
voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a
childlike joy.
INTERCUT BETWEEN DEEPCORE AND EXPLORER BRIDGE DURING THE FOLLOWING:
LINDSEY
It says...
""VIRGIL BRIGMAN BACK ON THE AIR/HAVE SOME NEW
FRIENDS DOWN HERE/I GUESS THEYVE BEEN HERE AWHILE/
THEYVE LEFT US ALONE BUT IT BOTHERS THEM TO SEE
US HURTING EACH OTHER/GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY""
Lindsey grins as she reads the next part...
LINSEY
""THEY SENT A MESSAGE/HOPE YOU GOT IT""
CATFISH
I'd say that's a big 10-4, jack.
LINDSEY
""THEY WANT US TO GROW UP A BIT AND PUT AWAY
CHILDISH THINGS/OF COURSE ITS JUST A SUGGESTION.""
INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY 240
Beyond the windows the ocean is calm. The sky steel-gray put placid. McBride
turns to Commodore DeMarco and the Navy contingent, his eyebrows cocked.
MCBRIDE
Looks like you boys might by out of business.
BENDIX
Something's going on down there. I'm getting
some big readings....
Bendix is hunched over the sonar, and we can see the screens lit up like a
Wurlitzer.
INT. DEEPCORE 241
In Deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling. The sonar
is going crazy. One Night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to
her ear, then jerks it away.
ONE NIGHT
Whew! Whatever this is, it's major.
The rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water.
The glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the
viewport, bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance.
A last message appears on the screen:
KEEP YOU PANTYHOSE ON/YOURE GONNA LOVE THIS
The radiance intensifies. Everyone covers their eyes. It flares to
WHITE-OUT.
CUT TO:
INT./EXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY 242
Bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts. All their instruments are pegged.
BENDIX
Active is pinging back something big... it's
enormous! Coming up right under us.
DEMARCO
Where?
BENDIX
Where? EVERYWHERE!!
(looks out the window)
Over there! Port bow.
EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN 243
A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not
swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.
It gets wider. Deeper. Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.
The ocean is OPENING.
Now the surface is churned by turbulence. Slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths.
McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.
The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.
The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.
SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING. A massive spire. Smoothly
curving and iridescent. Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another
spire rises. Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the
energy of Niagara.
Off the port bow... another spire.
And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.
Six towers... plus one larger, in the center. Rising.
One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun. The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF
CREATION.
And now for the payoff shot: WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN. THE SPIRES FORM A
PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS. A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM
THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS. THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED. IT IS ALL ONE.
THE NTI ARK.
It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back. We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic
being, which we assumed was a city. The Explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.
The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast, slightly curved hull. The missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.
ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy
contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.
Touched by the hand of God.
BENDIX
Look...
WHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore
Two. It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the
glistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.
CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.
Catfish's feet appear, bicycling. He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like. Jammer plonks down behind
him. He turns, lifts Lindsey down. Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into
the light of the sun. A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever
know.
LINDSEY
We should be dead. We didn't decompress.
CATFISH
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-
up Coke.
HIPPY
They must've done something to us.
Lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for
their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for
the whole human race.
LINDSEY
Oh, yes. I think you could say that.
She blinks. Seeing something not far away. She gives a little laugh, or
something between laughing and crying.
REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like
enterances to the NTI structure. His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.
She starts toward him. Breaks into a run. Then stops a few feet from him.
Watching him come to her.
His smile, his eyes illuminating her.
He stops and she touches him, lightly. Is this real?
The look at each other, wonderingly a moment.
Then laugh. She sniffs loudly.
LINDSEY
Hello, Brigman.
BUD
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Their lips meet.

FADE IN:
INT. C-130 HERCULES TURBO-PROP - NIGHT
Eighteen combat-ready special forces, wearing assault black,
jump packs and combat gear, stare down the deep end of a
greasy ramp into the night sky. Village lights flicker 19,000
feet below.
The STRIKE FORCE LEADER signals to his team.
Without a moment's hesitation, they dive into the darkness
and plummet toward earth.
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
A military GUARD, old Soviet-style uniform, rounds the corner
of the large estate toting an AK-47.
A red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and, after a
beat, the red dot seems to bleed. The Guard collapses dead.
Two other GUARDS are dispatched with single, silenced shots.
A Strike Team member at a junction box awaits a signal.
Through infra-red binoculars the strike Force Leader watches
his assault troops as they take positions.
STRIKE FORCE LEADER
(into headset/in
Russian)
GO!
On the estate - as the power goes out. The team on the
mansion's front porch pops the door and pours in.
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
FOLLOWING - the FIVE TEAM MEMBERS as they rush a stairway in
phalanx formation. They nearly knock over an old lady, who
in turn lets out a blood curdling scream.
UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR -
The team kicks open a door. Rushes into the room.
INT. BEDROOM -
Assault weapons pointed at the bed. The soldiers yank back
bedsheets to reveal IVAN STRAVANAVITCH, a middle-aged man
and his half-naked 18-year-old concubine.
SOLDIER
(in Russian)
Get up, now! Up!
The soldiers pull Stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out
of the room.
FOLLOWING - As they push down the hallway.
MANSION SECURITY GUARDS rally with haphazard gunfire.
Out come the strike force's flash-bang grenades. Exploding
everywhere, disorienting Stravanavitch's men.
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
Signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position.
The Strike Team evacuates across the field and forces a
struggling Stravanavitch into the low-hovering copter.
The commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of
Stravanavitch's guards break into the clearing. They open
fire.
And the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return.
One of the Strike Team members takes a bullet to the neck.
He's' pulled by his comrades into the chopper as it lifts
into the sky, its guns spitting lead...
STRIKE FORCE LEADER (V.0.)
Archangel, this is Restitution.
Archangel, this is Restitution. The package is wrapped.
Over.
VOICE (V.0. RADIO)
Roger, Restitution. We are standing
by for delivery.
FADE TO BLACK
The SOUNDS of a dinner banquet.
Forks clanking against plates and
the din of a hundred conversations,
broken by...
The DING, DING, DING of a SPOON tapping against a wine glass.
SUPER TITLE: ""MOSCOW - THREE WEEKS LATER
FADE IN:
INT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT
Hundreds of men and women in formal evening wear sit at round
banquet tables. A HUSH falls over the guests as the DINGING
continues. All attention turns to the front table.
A rotund, silver haired-man in his late sixties rises and
sidles past U.S. and Russian flags up to the podium
microphone. He is STOLI PETROV, President of Russia.
PETROV
(in Russian)
Thank you for joining us this evening.
Petrov's harsh Russian issues through the room. But over it
we hear a young woman's voice translating.
TRANSLATOR (V.0.)
Tonight we are honored to have with
us a man of remarkable courage, who,
despite strong international
criticism...
AT THE FRONT TABLE -
A translator's words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man
in his mid-forties. Worry lines crease his forehead and the
touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult
years in office.
This man is JAMES MARSHALL, and he is the PRESIDENT of the
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. He busily makes last minute changes
to his speech.
TRANSLATOR
(V.0. earpiece)
Has chosen to join our fight against
tyranny in forging a new world
community. Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you the President of the United
States of America...
Mr. President.
Thunderous applause as Marshall rises and approaches the
podium.
At the back of the room, DOHERTY, a senior policy adviser
whispers to the President's Chief of Staff ED SHEPHERD...
DOHERTY
Maybe we should consider running him
for re-election instead of the U.S.
The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.
MARSHALL
(in Russian with
subtitles)
Good evening and thank you. First I
would ask you to join me in a moment
of silence for the victims of the
Turkmenistan massacres.
The room remains silent a few beats. Most guests respectfully
bow their heads.
Marshall begins again, but this time in English. The young
woman translates simultaneously for the Russian audience.
MARSHALL
As you know, three weeks ago American
Special Forces, in cooperation with
the Russian Republican Army, secured
the arrest of Turkmenistan's self-
proclaimed dictator, General Ivan
Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic
reign had given new meaning to the
word horror. I am proud to say our
operation was a success.
Applause from the audience. Marshall turns the page on his
speech.
MARSHALL
And now, yesterday's biggest threat
to world peace... today awaits trial
for crimes against humanity.
During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech,
folds it and slides it into his pocket. He removes his
glasses and looks out into the crowd. His tone becomes more
personal.
He's not reciting the speech anymore.
MARSHALL
What we did here was important. We
finally pulled our heads out of the
sand, we finally stood up to the
brutality and said ""We've had enough.
Every time we ignore these atrocities--
the rapes, the death squads, the
genocides- every time we negotiate
with these, these thugs to keep them
out of gig country and away from gig
families, every time we do thiS.E.
we legitimize terror.
Terror is not a legitimate system of government. And to
those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer
tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer
be afraid. It's your turn to be afraid.
Applause rolls through the crowd.
EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT
Sprawling terminals spread out to runways like tentacles.
ON THE TARMAC -
Bathed in floodlights, perched majestically on the runway,
dwarfing nearby commuter and military jets, stands...
AIR FORCE ONE
The President's own Boeing 747-200,
dubbed ""the flying White House"".
The distinctive royal blue stripe
over a thin gold line tapers to a
tail adorned with the American flag
and the Presidential Seal Secret
Service agents and Marines stand
guard at the aircraft's perimeter.
A RUSSIAN NEWS VAN emerges from the darkness and pulls to a
stop by a Secret Service barricade.
SPECIAL AGENT GIBBS greets the Russian news team that emerges.
GIBBS
Gentlemen, welcome to Air Force One.
Please present your equipment to Special Agent Walters for
inspection.
The news team's segment producer, a crusty old Russian named
KORSHUNOV raises his big bushy eyebrows.
KORSHUNOV
We've already been inspected.
GIBBS
Sir, this plane carries the President
of the United States.
Though we wish to extend your press service every courtesy,
you will comply with our security measures to the letter.
KORSHUNOV
Of course. I'm sorry.
Korshunov and the FIVE MEMBERS of his news crew present their
video cameras, sound equipment and supplies to Special Agent
WALTERS for inspection. Secret Service DOGS sniff through
the baggage.
GIBBS
Please place your thumbs on the ID
pad.
Korshunov puts his thumb on the ID pad of a portable computer.
The computer matches up his thumbprint with his dossier and
photograph. ""CLEARED"" flashes on the computer screen.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
The President, walking with his entourage.
SHEPHERD
* CBS said they'll
give us four minutes. They thought
the Russian was a nice touch.
MARSHALL
I always wondered if my freshman
Russian class would come in handy.
DOHERTY
Sir, you threw out page two.
MARSHALL
Goddamn right I did. I asked for a
tough-as-nails speech and you gave
me diplomatic bullshit. What's the
point in having a speech if I have
to ad-lib?
DOHERTY
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
MARSHALL
Thanks. Wrote it last night.
The President exits the building and enters his limousine.
EXT. TARMAC - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Walters hands the bags back to the Russians.
WALTERS
Equipment checks out.
A striking woman in her early thirties descends Air Force
One's stairway. MARIA MITCHELL.
GIBBS
Gentlemen, this is Maria Mitchell.
Press Relations for the Presidential Flight Office. She'll
take you from here.
KORSHUNOV
Ms. Mitchell. So nice to finally
meet you in person.
MITCHELL
The President and I were delighted
that we could accommodate you. Now
if you're all cleared?
(Gibbs nods)
You can follow me then.
They ascend into the belly of Air Force One.
MITCHELL
* I'll be giving
you a brief tour, then during the
flight, two members of your crew
will be allowed out of the press
area at a time for filming. You
will have exactly ten minutes with
the President and twenty with the
crew...
EXT. STREETS OF MOSCOW, PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE - NIGHT
Winding its way down narrow cobblestone streets onto a major
thoroughfare.
INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
The limousine is packed with advisers, aides, military staff,
including LT. COL. PERKINS, the keeper of the NUCLEAR FOOTBALL
handcuffed to his wrist. In the b.g. on the limo's television
set, the LARRY KING SHOW indulges in its normal banter.
Marshall wearily rubs his temples as he stifles a yawn.
SHEPHERD
You wanna knock of f?
MARSHALL
No, no. I'm fine. What did the
Speaker say?
SHEPHERD
He and the NRA don't like the wording.
DOHERTY
Apparently taking uzis away from
sixth graders isn't as popular as we
thought it'd be. Representative
Taylor is working on a compromise.
MARSHALL
Put together a score sheet. I'll
make some calls.
SHEPHERD
With all due respect, sir, maybe you
should give them this one. Your
numbers are still pretty low and you
called in a lot of chips to nail
Stravanavitch.
MARSHALL
I might still have a few chips left.
SHEPHERD
* We could always
put you in a duck blind with a twelve
gauge. The second amendment types'll
love that.
MARSHALL
This is a crime bill, Shep. Killing
a couple ducks won't get it through
committee. Besides, Shep, I told
you... I don't shoot babies and I
don't kiss guns.
SHEPHERD
Other way around, sir.
MARSHALL
(realizing what he
said)
Right... Christ I'm tired. Do me a
favor and keep me away from the press.
Marshall's watch alarm beeps and he automatically reaches
into his breast pocket, pulls out a medicine vial and downs
two pills with a coffee chaser.
On the T.V.
LARRY KING (T.V.)
... and your reaction to the
President's trip to Moscow. Good or
bad?
Shepherd turns up the volume.
SHEPHERD
This is the part I wanted you to
see.
REP. DANFORTH (T.V.)
Criminal. One of our boys died in
Marshall's little publicity stunt
and for what? So we could claim
victory over another country's
problems instead of our own? And
now he's got the nerve to prance
around Moscow gloating, while that
poor boy's family is left to bury
him. If I were Marshall, I'd be
ashamed of myself.
LARRY KING
There you have it. Harsh words for
the President from Michael Danforth,
the Speaker of the House.
Marshall mutes the television. A quiet moment.
SHEPHERD
* My opinion.
We can't let him get away with that
kind of language.
Marshall considers. Then decides.
MARSHALL
It's bait. Don't take it.
SHEPHERD
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked
this administration on national
television. You can't afford to
leave that hanging.
MARSHALL
(ignoring Shepherd)
Did we tape the Duke game?
AIDE
It's waiting on the plane. The ending
was pretty...
MARSHALL
(interrupting)
Please don't tell me. Just for once,
* let me be
surprised.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE, CORRIDOR, TRAVELING - NIGHT
Maria Mitchell escorts the Russians down the plane's length.
As they pass the galley, Maria motions up a set of stairs.
MITCHELL
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit
and the Mission Communication Center.
The MCC, as we call it, can place
clear and secure phone calls to
anywhere on earth. We're linked to
a network of military and civilian
satellites and ground stations. We
could run the country or run a war
from there if we had to.
KORSHUNOV
This is a remarkable aircraft.
MITCHELL
You don't know the half of it. Did
you know this entire plane is shielded
from radiation? We could fly through
a mushroom cloud completely unharmed
if necessary.
KORSHUNOV
A dubious distinction, no?
MITCHELL
I guess it depends on your
perspective.
They walk by several conference rooms, running down the
starboard side of the plane.
KORSHUNOV
And all these rooms here?
MITCHELL
Conference rooms, though some have
other functions. The one up front
doubles as an emergency medical
center.
Past the conference rooms, they walk by a small side room
where SECRETARIES work on computers, generating documents.
MITCHELL
As you can see, back here's more
like a regular plane. Security and
Secret Service take this cabin.
You'll be in the rear with the press
pool.
The REAR PRESS CABIN, just ahead of the rear galley and bank
of bathrooms. A handful of disgruntled reporters feign sleep.
MITCHELL
Here's a press kit. I'll let you
guys get comfortable and once we're
airborne I'll be able to schedule
the interviews.
KORSHUNOV
Thank you.
Mitchell exits forward. One of the reporters stirs and looks
up at the news team. He groans. Space is a premium back
here.
REPORTER
You fellas win some sort of fly-with-
POTUS contest?
KORSHUNOV
Potus? What is Potus?
REPORTER
P.O.T.U.S. President Of The United
States.
KORSHUNOV
Ah, no. We won nothing. We are
ITAR-TASS news service.
REPORTER
Right. Listen, this here... This is
my row. You'll have to sit over
there.
Korshunov trades looks with his news team.
EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT
The President's motorcade pulls up in front of Air Force
One.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
The President and his entourage ascend from the lower deck
platform onto the main deck. COL. DANIEL AXELROD, Air Force
One's pilot, snaps off a salute as he passes.
COL. AXELROD
Welcome aboard, Mr. President.
MARSHALL
(returns salute)
Hey Danny. How's it look tonight?
COL. AXELROD
Glassy, sir. Care to take the wheel?
MARSHALL
You keep offering, one of these days
I'll take you up on it.
(to no one in
particular)
Rose and Alice back yet?
AIDE
No, Mr. President. The ballet ran
late. Their ETA is seventeen minutes.
Marshall nods as he pulls off his bow tie and enters his
stateroom. Shepherd follows two steps behind.
SHEPHERD
Mr. President?
Marshall halts Shepherd with a gesture.
MARSHALL
Thirty seconds.
Shepherd nods and waits by the door. Lt. Col. Perkins takes
a seat outside the Presidents stateroom and opens the latest
Tom Clancy thriller, using the nuclear football as a lap
desk.
INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
Marshall collapses on the couch, rubs his eyes, then closes
them. A moment of peace in a breakneck day.
The knock at the door jars him.
MARSHALL
Yes.
Shepherd enters.
SHEPHERD
Can I at least issue a press release
objecting to the Speaker's choice of
wording?
President Marshall picks up one of the many phones in his
office.
MARSHALL
I said it's not worth the fight.
(into phone)
Steward, please.
SHEPHERD
We'll just say it was in bad taste.
* MARSHALL
Forget it, Shep. The kid gave his life for his country and
the
Speaker's a bastard for turning him into a sound bite. I'll
take the heat. Understood?
SHEPHERD
You give me ulcers.
MARSHALL
That's my job.
A STEWARD enters the room.
STEWARD
Mr. President?
MARSHALL
Hey Mike. Could you get me a
Heineken?
SHEPHERD
No, wait. Get him one of the Russian
beers.
The steward nods and disappears from the room.
SHEPHERD
We've got those Russian news guys on
board and it'll look good in the
papers.
Marshall picks up a stack of policy reports. Thumbs through
them.
MARSHALL
C'mon Shep. I've been eating borscht
and drinking vodka for days. Isn't
that enough?
(off paper)
New home starts are down.
The steward arrives with the Russian beer. Marshall takes a
swig. He swallows hard. Piss-water. Marshall crosses to
his sink and pours the beer out. He hands the bottle to the
steward.
MARSHALL
Fill this with Heineken.
The steward nods...
STEWARD
Yes, Mr. President.
AND SLINKS AWAY WITH THE BOTTLE. MARSHALL CATCHES HIMSELF --
MARSHALL
I don't believe this. I'm playing
politics with a bottle of beer. A
goddamn bottle of beer. I've been
in office too long.
SHEPHERD
Look on the bright side... if the
polls don't change, you won't have
that problem, sir.
Marshall picks up the phone again.
MARSHALL
Yeah. Put the Duke game on in my
room.
INT. AFO'S MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT
THREE Air Force SPECIALISTS man the elaborate communication
system occupying much of the upper deck. Top-of-the-line
computers, communication systems, video decks, and satellite
receivers.
AIR FORCE SPECIALIST
Yes, Mr. President.
He slides in a videotape and channels the feed to the *
president's stateroom.
INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
A monitor comes to life with a basketball game.
MARSHALL
(to Shepherd)
Defense and State Department in the
conference room in one hour. I want
to review the Iraq situation.
SHEPHERD
Yes, sir.
Shepherd exits as Marshall settles into his leather chair
and dives into work. He punches a button on the speakerphone.
MARSHALL
Get me the Housing Secretary...
EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
The Marine Guards snap to attention once again as the First
Lady's motorcade arrives.
ROSE MARSHALL, a self-assured woman with an aristocratic
gleam, alights from her limo. She takes a few steps, then
turns, tapping her foot impatiently.
ROSE
C'mon Alice, we're 20 minutes late.
Your father's gonna have a fit.
ALICE, the President's 13-year-old daughter, straggles out
of the car, rolling her eyes.
ALICE
It's not like he hasn't made us wait
a few times.
ROSE
Well, you aren't the President, dear.
ALICE
Yeah, no duh.
INT. MAIN DECK, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
As the First Lady's entourage enters.
ROSE
Why don't you go say hi?
Again, Alice rolls her eyes.
ROSE
What is wrong with you tonight?
Come here.
Rose pulls Alice aside.
ROSE
You don't want to say hi to your
father?
ALICE
I'm sure he's busy.
ROSE
Don't you even want to ask?
Alice toes her foot into the carpet as she releases an
exasperated sigh. She is, in this moment, the patron saint
of know-it-all 13-year-old girls. Alice waves toward the
Presidential Suite.
ALICE
If I go over there to say hi to daddy
President, Mike's going to tell me
he's in a meeting and can't be
disturbed. Then when the plane starts
to taxi, he'll come out and say ""Hey,
are you guys back? Did you enjoy
the ballet?"" But he'll be on his
way to another meeting and won't
wait for an answer. Then you'll get
pissed at him and he'll get pissed
at you. It's like you guys rehearse
or something.
With the weight of the entire world on her shoulders, Alice
Collapses into one of the many leather chairs. It seems to
swallow her. JORY, a steward passes.
ALICE
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double
whip cream.
ROSE
Alice...
ALICE
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
ROSE
You're jet-lagged. We'll talk about
this back...
ALICE
Back at The Fishbowl?
Alice eyes the swirl of Aides who are pretending to work
nearby.
But it's obvious that they're eavesdropping. Alice smiles
and waves at them dramatically.
ROSE
We'll talk at home.
(beat)
You know, most girls aren't as lucky
as you. For most girls seeing the
Bolshoi ballet would be the experience
of a lifetime.
ALICE
I know, Mom.
(sees the hurt in her
mom's eyes and softens)
It was great... really.
Rose nods, smiling a half-smile. After a thoughtful beat,
Alice gets up and crosses to the Presidential suite. She
exchanges words with the Aide standing outside the door and
comes back, covering her disappointment.
ALICE
He's in a meeting. He can't be
disturbed.
ROSE
I'm sorry, honey.
ALICE
No, it's okay. After all, he is the
President, right?
Joey the steward hands her her cocoa with a wink and a smile.
Her eyes light up at the mound of whip cream on top.
ALICE
When I write my memoirs I think I'll
devote an entire chapter to the cocoa
aboard Air Force One.
ROSE
Your father never means to be so...
ALICE
I know...
(beat)
But lotsa times I feel like it's me
versus the world. Some kid at school
teases me and the same day a plague
breaks out in Bangladesh. I mean it
doesn't take a genius to figure which
is more important.
ROSE
Some kids were teasing you?
ALICE
That's not really the point.
A quiet pause, then...
ROSE
You're right and I'll tell you a
secret. I know exactly how you feel.
ALICE
Big secret. You said the same thing
to Newsweek.
The plane jolts forward as it begins to taxi.
ALICE
We're taxiing. Ready. And... five...
four... three.. two... one... Cue
Daddy.
Alice points. And as if on cue, Marshall exits from his
office and checks his watch.
ALICE
Oooooh, I'm good.
MARSHALL
Hey, you guys back already?
Alice nods.
MARSHALL
How was...
(thinks, then remembers)
...the ballet?
ALICE
(theatrically)
It was the experience of a lifetime.
MARSHALL
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Alice rises and hugs her father. A White House PHOTOGRAPHER
snaps off a few shots for the papers. Alice makes a face at
them. A second later, Shepherd comes up the corridor,
breaking up the pair.
SHEPHERD
Mr. President... they're ready for
you in the conference room.
MARSHALL
Okay. Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me
all about it later, right?
ALICE
Sure.
As Marshall moves toward the conference room, he bends and
gives Rose a quick peck on the cheek. It all reeks of
formality.
ROSE
May I speak to you for a moment?
MARSHALL
Can't it wait?
ROSE
No, Mr. President. It can't.
INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.
Rose shuts the door behind them. As she starts to speak,
Marshall pulls her into a long passionate kiss. Rose pulls
away.
ROSE
Don't. I know spin control when I
feel it.
MARSHALL
Rose, I don't have time for this.
I've gotta go stop a war.
ROSE
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and
stop acting like the little dutch
boy. Not even you can plug all the
world's leaks. Don't you think it's
a sign you're pushing too hard when
your daughter sees more of you on
MTV news than in person.
MARSHALL
She's a big girl. She understands.
ROSE
How do you know she understands?
You haven't spent more than five
minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
MARSHALL
And when have I had five minutes?
When I wake up in the morning and
I'm already three hours behind
Schedule. What do you want me to
do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off
because I'm a family man?
(BEAT)
I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.
ROSE
No. It wasn't.
He takes her in his arms.
MARSHALL
You know what?
ROSE
What?
MARSHALL
I miss you. And I miss her.
ROSE
But that's the point, Jim. We're
right here.
MARSHALL
I wish it were that easy...
Long beat. He smiles at her, it's the same sweet smile that
won her heart, the same smile that got him elected. She
softens.
MARSHALL
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
ROSE
I should trust that promise? Because
you know the voters are still waiting
for that middle class tax cut.
MARSHALL
This promise isn't subject to
Congressional approval.
She smiles. The tension breaks.
ROSE
How did your speech go?
MARSHALL
Well, they aren't burning me in
effigy. That's always a good sign.
They kiss again, this time for real. But... a knock on the
door.
SHEPHERD (0.5.)
Mr. President.
Shepherd opens the door.
MARSHALL
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep
here thinks I'll be a one termer.
ROSE
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to
schedule your daughter in?
SHEPHERD
She is scheduled. Her school play's
Tuesday night.
Rose rolls her eyes.
MARSHALL
The First Lady was making a joke,
Shep. I'll make some time, Rose. I
promise.
Marshall heads for his meeting.
EXT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
Col. Axelrod and his co-pilot LT. COL. ARTHUR INGRAHAMS are

RUSSIAN AIR TRAFFIC (V.0)
(THICK ACCENT)
United States Air Force One, this is
tower. It's an honor to clear you
for immediate take-off on runway
three.
COL. AXELROD
Roger, Tower. And thank you for the
hospitality.
Axeirod eases up the throttle and the four GE-F103 Turbofan
engines spring to life.
EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT
A picture perfect take-off as Air Force One slides through
the moonlight and skates upward on a sheet of air.
EXT. AIR FORCE ONE, FLYING - AN HOUR LATER
Airborne in the midnight sky.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE, GALLEY - NIGHT
Aircraft engines drone.
CLOSE ON - A coffee pot pouring piping joe into a mug
emblazoned with ubiguitou Presidential Seal. The mug is placed
on a tray with a half-dozen other mugs and passed to a STEW.
He carries the tray down the corridor past passenger cabins.
Drowsiness has overtaken the plane. Many of the passengers
and aides are asleep. CNN plays On T.V. sets, entertaining
the few night owls and news junkies.
CNN REPORTER (T.V.)
In an unusually aggressive speech,
the President characterized the
Stravanavitch regime as thugs whose
brutality will no longer be tolerated.
Meanwhile, in Turkmenistan,
Stravanavitch's ouster has sent the
country into turmoil. Tens of
thousands of refugees continue to
huddle in U.N. safe havens, as rival
Stravanavitch loyalists fight among
themselves for control. But at least
for the time being, the ethnic
cleansing has been stopped.
Toward the front of the plane, the steward enters the
conference room.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
As the steward closes the door behind him, all background
noise disappears. We are in a sound shielded room. Even the
engines' drone cannot be heard.
The lights in the room are dim as MAJOR CALDWELL, a military
advisor, projects satellite photos of Iraqi military bases
onto a screen.
The steward serves coffee as unobtrusively as he can while
the meeting continues.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100
hours. What you see here is the
mobilization of two mechanized
brigades.
MARSHALL
They've gotta be joking.
DOHERTY
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming
it's just an exercise.
MARSHALL
An exercise in futility. Send the
Nimitz back in.
MAJOR CALDWELL
The northern border's gotten a bit
hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag
with our Tomcats and our boys are
just itching to engage.
MARSHALL
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I
don't need `em creating policy for
me.
We follow the steward as he slips out of the conference room
and back into the...
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
with a few coffees left on his tray. One of them is scooped
up by Gibbs as he passes, his nose is buried in a fax.
INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT
Gibbs leans in the cabin.
GIBBS
Hey Walters, you and Johnson come
here a second. Reykjavik just sent
the advance team report.
Special Agents Walters and JOHNSON rise and follow Gibbs
into an adjoining office.
INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Gibbs closes the door behind the two agents. As Walters and
Johnson take their seats, Gibbs WITHDRAWS HIS WEAPON and...
SHOOTS each of the agents in THE BACK OF THE HEAD.
Silenced pistol. Blood all over the desk. Gibbs removes each
of the agent's weapons and slips them into his waistband. He
waits a few beats, takes a long sip of coffee, then exits
the office.
INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT
As he passes through the cabin he takes a silent inventory.
Five other agents working, sleeping, on the phone.
INT. PRESS CABIN - NIGHT
Gibbs nods to Korshunov. Korshunov nods one of his men.
NEVSKY removes one of his videotapes, pops the front cover
exposing the tape. Across the face of the tape is a thin
strip of a rubbery substance. Nevsky pulls the strip up and
out, making a kind of fuse. He reaches for a pack of
matches... courtesy matches, sporting the Seal of the
President.
Nevsky nods and lights the fuse.
IN A RAPID SUCCESSION -
GIBBS tosses his two extra weapons to Korshunov's men, pivots
the corner and begins firing at his colleagues. The SECRET
SERVICE AGENTS try to get at their weapons, but Gibbs has
caught them completely off-guard.
Several silenced central nervous system shots (head and neck)
and the five agents slump back, their red blood cascading
down the creases of the fine Corinthian leather chairs.
Nevsky tosses the cassette up the corridor... smoke pours
out of it. Smoke screen.
BAZYLEV and ZEDECK catch the guns Gibbs tossed and hold them
on the reporters.
BAZYLEV
UP! GET UP NOW!
Bazylev grabs the stunned reporters, yanking them into the
aisle.
BAZYLEV
Walk in front of us. Go! Go! Go!
Human shields. A half dozen of them.
Behind the terrorists, one of the bathroom doors swings open.
A SECRET SERVICE AGENT emerges. Sees what's happening. Reaches
for his gun. ZEDECK fells him with a well placed unsilenced
GUN SHOT. SCREAMS ensue...
INT. FORWARD CABIN - NIGHT
A sleeping SECRET SERVICE AGENT bolts upright. HEARS MORE
SHOTS.
He springs up and moves toward the gunshots, his weapon drawn.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
SHOTS FIRED! SECURE BOY SCOUT!
(screaming out and
into his lapel mike)
SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!
INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT
Bazylev and Zedeck lay down a suppressing fire outside the
door.
GIBBS
Come on! Quickly.
Korshunov, Nevsky and VLAD follow Gibbs into the Secret
Service office. Gibbs opens a locker and pulls out a stash
of MP5 automatic assault rifles and bullet-proof vests.
Korshunov raises his bushy eyebrows in delight.
GIBBS
The Secret Service believes in being
prepared for any eventuality.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
The Secret Service agent fights his way through the smoke to
a wall panel. Punches a red buttoned intercom.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE'S FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
A red light on the security panel lights up...
SECRET SERVICE AGENT (V.0.)

RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER
Air Force One Heavy, acknowledged.
We are scrambling our fighters.
The controller hits a red button on his console. Sirens flare
up and klaxons wail across the base.
The controller looks down to his runways. In the light of
the moon he sees a half-dozen men rushing toward F-15 Eagles.
RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLLR
Call Berlin Tower. Not a plane lands
or takes off within two hundred miles!

The once sleepy midnight control room cranks into full crisis

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
The conference room door bursts open and TWO SECRET SERVICE
AGENTS, weapons drawn, enter the room and run to Marshall.
The once quiet room floods with light. The sounds of a
gunfight and a blanket of smoke sweeps into the cabin.
MARSHALL
What's going on?
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
We're under attack.
MARSHALL
Where's my family?
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
We're handling it, sir.
The agents lift Marshall to his feet, and practically carry
him from the room, leaving the other high ranking officials
to scramble for themselves in a cacophony of shouts.
MARSHALL
The launch codes! Who's protecting
the football?
FORWARD CORRIDOR -
Perkins, carrying the nuclear football, ducks and weaves his
way down the corridor into the fray. He takes a bullet to
the shoulder, which fells him.
NEAR THE FORWARD GALLEY -
Alice is nearly trampled by agents responding to the gunfire.
One agent grabs her and shoves her into a bathroom.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Don't open the door!
GUNFIRE pops all around her.
INT. CORRIDOR, REAR CABINS - NIGHT
Smoke, automatic weapons fire. Secret service agents battling
the terrorists. Aides, diplomats, crew and personnel caught
in the crossfire.
ZEDECK

A spray of weapons fire overhead and everyone hits the floor.
ZEDECK
STAY DOWN, PLACE YOUR HANDS BEHIND
YOUR HEAD AND YOU WILL NOT BE SHOT!
INT. AIR FORCE ONE, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Ingrahams locks the cockpit door.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
Air Force One banks into a curve and descends through broken
clouds.
INT. PRESIDENTIAL STATEROOM - NIGHT
The sounds of gunfire have reached the the nose of the plane.
Rose peers out to see what's the matter. An armed Secret
Service agent runs toward her.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Get back! Get back!
A spray of bullets mows him down. He collapses in the door
frame. Terrified, Rose tries to close the door, but the dead
agent is in the way.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Filled with smoke and gunfire. The agents rush the President
behind a forward bulkhead.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
(into mike)
We have Boy Scout, traveling forward.
VOICE (OVER MIKE)
Negative... negative... they're up
here too.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Roger. We're going to the chute.
Marshall looks up the hallway toward his stateroom.
MARSHALL
(calling out)
ROSE! ALICE!
DOWN THE CORRIDOR -
Gibbs fires.
HITS - One of the Secret Service agents in the shoulder.
Blood blossoms through his clothes but he winces it off.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Come on, sir.
The Secret Service agents whisk the President to the front
stairwell. They pull up a floor panel, revealing stairs
descending toward the baggage deck.
INT. BATHROOM -
Alice, huddled atop the commode.
MARSHALL (O.S.)
Alice!
ALICE
Daddy...
Alice opens the door and rushes...
INTO THE CORRIDOR...
Tripping and falling over Joey, the steward. His dead eyes
swim in a pool of blood that was his face. Alice screams,
scrambling to her feet.
MID-PLANE CORRIDOR -
Perkins manages to push himself to his feet and stumbles
down the hall into the computer room. Terrorist SERGE spots
the nuclear football dangling from his wrist. He pursues.
INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT
Hysterical SECRETARIES feverishly dump classified documents
into a shredder, while Perkins struggles to open the black
leather briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.
Bullets tear up the doorknob lock arid SERGE kicks in the
door.
SERGE
Down! Everyone down!
The Fawn Halls hit the floor as gunfire sprays overhead. But
Perkins swings around brandishing his sidearm. He opens fire
on Serge, but the bullets smack harmlessly against the SWAT
vest.
Serge returns fire, ripping up Perkins who collapses over
the shredder, and with his last bit of strength, he dumps
out the briefcase.
Papers containing NUCLE WAR STRATEGIES and MISSILE LAUNCH
CODES slide into the hungry Shredding machine. Perkins manages
a slight smile before he keels over dead, his duty fulfilled.
The shredded remains of the nuclear football rain over his
head like tickertape at a hero's parade.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
The pale moon catches shiny streaks of metal that descend
through the broken clouds. The Squadron of F-15 Eagles drops
into formation around Air Force One.
INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Gun shots right Outside the cockpit door.
COT. CARLTON (RADIO)
Air Force One, this is Squadron
Commander Canton. You are now under
escort. All airspace has been cleared.
COL. AXELROD
This is Air Force One Heavy. I'm
coming in full throttle. ETA to
Ranstein eight minutes. We've got a
war here, sir.
INT. COCKPIT F-LB EAGLE - NIGHT
Encased in a helmet, mask, and visor, Carlton watches the
flashes of gunfire in the dark windows of the plane.
COt. CARLTON Copy. Delta Force has been mobilized.
COT. AXELROD (V.0.)
Roger that.
INT. LOWER DECK OF AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Beneath the main cabin, the Secret Service agents run the
President through the forward baggage compartment and the
lower galley: a large room with compartments, storage freezers
and food preperation tables.
On the far side of the galley, the agents fling open a
hatchway and enter...
A NARROW GANGWAY - running between the lower galley and the
rear baggage hold, flanked on either side by the landing
gear bays.
They duck under wing supports until they come to a mesh
grating.
The uninjured agent lifts the grating revealing an ESCAPE
POD.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Get in!
Marshall freezes.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
Get in, sir.
A second later gunfire rips Up the agent's face. The new
volley sends Marshall under the cover of a wing strut. The
second agent takes Position and returns fire. He quells the
incoming volley for a moment.
MARSHALL
What about my family?
SECRET SERVICE AGENT #
I have a family, too, sir. Now get
in the fucking pod.
The firing begins again. Marshall struggles with the decision.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT #
Mr. President... MR. PRESIDENT! You
have to do this! The pod, on three.
Ready?
The agent shoves in a fresh clip...
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
One.
MARSHALL
But...
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
(cutting him off)
Two... THREE. GO!
The agent combat-rolls into the open and fires. He advances
down the gangway acting as a shield for the president,
shooting blindly. Marshall watches as he's hit repeatedly,
but it gives him the time he needs to dive for the pod.
REVERSE ANGLE - VLAD AND NEVSKY
behind the bulkhead. When the agent drops, Nevsky and Viad
rush down the gangway. They arrive at the closed pod just as
it begins to slide on its rails. They let loose dozens of
rounds from their MP55, but the bullets just plink off.
The pod-lock doors slide shut. The President is on his way
to safety.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
Small bay doors open in the belly of Air Force One, and a
human sized cannister drops from the bottom, its parachute
Opening instantly.

INT. BAGGAGE DECK GANGWAY - NIGHT
ALICE (O.S.)
Daddy? Dad?
Her voice comes closer, filled with choking fear and panic.
She rounds the corner and Nevsky catches her hair with a
vice-tight grip shoving his MP5 into the small of her back.
NEVSKY
Your father has left you behind.
INT. PRESIDENTIAL STATEROOM - NIGHT
Korshunov kicks open the door.
ROSE
NO!
Gunfire from ROSE, who holds the dead secret service agent's
weapon. She empties the clip at the doorway. Click, click.
No more bullets. Korshunov steps into the room, brandishing
his automatic, smiling. Rose backs against the wall and raises
her hands.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - DAY
A Marine helicopte touches down on the greenway. Marines
salute and escort KATHERINE CHANDLER from the chopper'
interior to the South entrance of the White House. She is
the VICE PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE, MISSION COMNUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT
Zedeck steps over the three dead Communications Specialists,
on his way to the cockpit door. Tries the door. It's locked.
He pounds on it.
ZEDECK
Open! Now!
INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Through the cockpit window, the glowing landing lights of
Ramstein Base are visible in the distance, cutting a wedge
through the German towns and fields.
Zedeck's pounding continues.
COT. AXELROD
Ramatein, we are fifteen miles away
on final approach. I'm coming in

Final approach... the landing strip not far at all.
COL. AXELROD
Almost there.
He raises his flaps. Air speed and altitude drop.
EXT. RAPISTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT
Spotters find Air Force One's navigation lights visible in
the sky, descending from the distant darkness. Followed by
the cluster of F-lSs.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Altitude decreasing. 300 feet... 200 hundred feet...
The runway coming up to meet them.
EXT. RAMSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT
As the entire airbase collectively holds its breath. Air

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
A BLINDING FLASH. The door blows in.
EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT
The wheels touchdown.
INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT
Gibbs and Zedeck storm the cockpit.
RNT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Axeirod gropes at the plane's controls, trying to retain the
wheel. Gibbs dispatches Axeirod with one shot. Zedek is a
little messier with Ingrahams. But both pilot and co-pilot
slump over their controls.
EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT
The taxiing Boeing 747 suddenly veers to the right cutting
across runways. Emergency vehicles give chase.
The plane bounces. Is airborne for a second. Touches down
again with a jolt.
INT. CORRIDOR - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Terrorists lead hostages to the conference room. Everyone is
bounced around, slamming against walls, spilling over chairs.
A MASTER SERGEANT seizes the opportunity and grabs for
Bazylev's gun, but Bazylev shoots him almost point blank.
BAZYLEV
Keep moving!
INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Chaos. Gibbs tries to pull Axelrod off the controls.
GIBBS
Throttle up. Throttle up!
Zedek slams the throttle all the wa up. Spotlights and sirens
swirl outside the cockpit window.
EXT. RMMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT
The Flying White House careens toward the barracks, then
edges toward a hangar. The jet engines strain to reach full
power.
INT. RAMSTEIN CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT
The controller stares down at the out-of-control plane.
RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER
Aw Fuck. We're losing it!
INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Gibbs pulls Axeirod's body out of the pilot's seat. Looks
out the cockpit window and sees...
A C-141 STARLIFTER
in his path. A monstrous plane, every
bit as big as Air Force One. Gibbs
eases back on the wheel and the 747
sluggishly responds, its nose creeping
upward.
GIBBS
Come on.
Adjusts the flaps...
EXT. RAMSTEIN AIRFIELD - NIGHT
Air Force One closes in on the Starlifter. She's struggling
off
the ground like some injured bird. The straining metal defies
gravity.
INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT
Gibbs senses that he's too close. He pulls way back on the
stick, risks stalling her out... but the bird responds.
EXT. RAMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT
Air Force One barely clears the Starlifter, the edge of her
wing just missing the top of the C-141's tail.
The sharpshooters, the emergency crews, the commandos from
Delta Force... Nothing they can do but watch her rise out.

Okay, 30,000 feet. Give me my heading.
ZEDECK

Gibbs banks the plane into a curve, then activates the auto-
pilot.
GIBBS
Call me if something changes.
ZEDECK
That's it?
GIBBS
To fly a 747 you need to know three
things. How to take of f, how to
land, and how to engage the autopilot.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
SERIES OF SHOTS--
The terrorists, from every corner of the plane, lead the
stunned survivors, hands on heads, to the central conference
room.
As Korshunov walks Rose up the corridor, he meets up with
Gibbs, descending from the upper deck.
KORSHUNOV
The rest of the secret service?
GIBBS
Dead.
KORSHUNOV
How many others killed?
GIBBS
Nine.
KORSHUNOV
Any of us?
Gibbs touches his bulletproof vest.
GIBBS
No damages.
ROSE
Where's my daughter?
GIBBS
She's alive, ma'am, for the time
being.
Rose allows herself a half-sob of relief.
ROSE
And my husband?
GIBBS
The secret service did their job,
ma'am. The President is safely off
the plane.
(to Korshunov)
But that still leaves us plenty to
bargain with.
Eyes filled with hatred... Rose SLAPS Gibbs face.
ROSE
Mr. Gibbs. You, of all people...
Gibbs doesn't react.
GIBBS
Follow me, ma'am.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
High-tech maps and communications systems line the walls,
surrounding an austere main conference table. Laptop computers

machines spitting out classified information.
VICE PRESIDENT CHANDLER analyzes the projected course of Air
Force One on the tactical vid-map.
V.P. CHANDLER
We should have the President secure
within minutes. Do we know who these
terrorists are or where they're going?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
General Greely says it looks like
the Middle East.
V.P. CHANDLER
Does your office have anything to
add, Mr. Dean?
National Security Advisor WALTER DEAN leans forward.
DEAN
The garners believe that, given the
scenario, there's an 86% chance that
we'll be dealing with a hostage situation and not an
assassination attempt. Not much else until there's more data.
V.P. CHANDLER
If we're dealing with an airborne
hostage situation what's our
procedure?
The Under-Secretary of Defense, THOMAS LEE, punches up a
scenario on the lap-top.
LEE
Our only policy assumes the plane is
on the ground. Our hands are
completely tied while they're in the
air.
V.P. CHANDLER
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action
until we confirm that the president
is off the plane... Lee, go huddle
with the D.O.D. I want an options
paper on this in 20 minutes.
LEE
Twenty minutes?
V.P. CHANDLER
You heard me.
(points to an aide)
You. Congress and cabinet heads.
The aide nods and picks up a telephone.
AIR FORCE COLONEL
Madame Vice-President?
Chandler turns toward the door. The Colonel enters the room,
holding a black briefcase identical to Perkins'.
V.P. CHANDLER
Yes?
AIR FORCE COLONEL

INT. BAGGAGE DECK GANGWAY - NIGHT
Bruised and battered, some blood smeared across his tuxedo
shirt... PRESIDENT JAMES MARSHALL lowers himself from one of
the overhead wing struts.
He emerges into the bowels of Air Force one.
He stands quietly a moment, listening... for footsteps, for
gunfire. All quiet except for the whine of the jet engines.
He tak9s a moment to think. Considers his situation. His
eyes find the dead agent who risked his life so he could
make it to the pod. He trots down the gangway toward the
lower galley.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
Air Force One hovers atop billowy peaks. The smaller F-15s
cluster around her in a loose formation.

Rose holds Alice, comforting her. shepherd, Doherty, Aides,

The plane's doctor administers to the wounded.
Korshunov stares down his captives.
KORSHUNOV
Fear will keep you alive. Any one
who is not afraid is bound to do
something foolish, and bound to die.
ROSE
What do you want with us?
KORSHUNOV
Cooperation. If you try to escape,
you will be met with automatic gunfire
and a barricade of your comrade's
bodies will prevent you from exiting.
Good day.
Korshunov exits, with Viad backing out behind him. Leaving
the hostages alone. The sound of the door locking.
A mournful beat. Everyone looks at each other and the dead
and wounded victims of this heinous act...
Hushed conversation breaks out all over the room.
DOHERTY
This can't be happening. You just

States. You just don't.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Keep your heads.
Caldwell paces, looks around the room.
SHEPHERD
Mrs. Marshall, are you okay?
ROSE
We're alive.
SHEPHERD
That's all that matters. Thank god
the President got of f the plane.
ROSE
Yes... thank God.
(to caldwell)
You there... Caidwell, right? What's
on your mind? caldwell takes a beat,
then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.
MAJOR CALDWELL
(hushed)
I don't want to get anybody here
excited, but if we can get out of
this room, I can get us to safety.
SHEPHERD
We're thirty five thousand feet up.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if
we can somehow get to a lower
altitude, the rear loading ramp on
the baggage deck is equipped with
parachutes in case of an engine
failure. Now we can either wait for
a political resolution, or try to
resolve this thing ourselves.
DOHERTY
You're goddamn right we can resolve
this ourselves. We'll negotiate.
SHEPHERD
You know the President's policy.
DOHERTY
The President isn't here.
ROSE
Right now we are an enormous liability
to the United States. We can't just
sit and do nothing.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
The terrorists move toward the nose of the plane leaving
Nevsky to guard the conference room.
INT. BAGGAGE HOLD - NIGHT
President Marshall reaches the front stairway. Cautiously
climbs to the main cabin. As he reaches the top stairs, he
hears Russian conversation approaching. He ducks back into
the stairwell.
He can't see them, but he can hear them.
The terrorists pass within a few feet as they ascend to the
Mission Communications Center on the upper deck.
Marshall waits a few beats, listens to the silence. Then re-
mounts the stairs and almost runs into the back of...
VIAD
Standing guard, facing the opposite
direction.
Marshall FREEZES... looks past Viad down the corridor where
Nevsky guards the main conference room floor.
Unaware of Marshall, Viad reaches into his pocket and pulls
out a cigarette. Lights it. On the first puff he feels a
presence behind him.
VLAD slowly turns around...
Nothing there.
He smiles at his jittery nerves, turns back round.
REVERSE ANGLE -
Over Vlad's shoulder...
MARSHALL, flattened behind the edge of the galley divider.
He creeps away from Vlad toward the Presidential Suite...
stepping gingerly over dead secret service agents.
INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -
* Korshunov pulls a handkerchef from his breast pocket
and wipes the blood from a telephone headset.
KORSHUNOV
Proceed.
Gibbs works the communications board, dialing in a series of
numbers. Telephone ringing...
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
A map of Air Force One's flight trajectory is displayed on
the rear screen. Moscow to Berlin and back toward the Black
Sea.
The assembled brass listens as Korshunov's voice slithers
off the speaker phone.
KORSHUNOV (SPEAKER)
...the Chief of Staff, the First
Lady, and the First Daughter. Our
demands are simple. Arrange the
release of Ivan Stravanvitch. Once
our leader is returned to Turkuenistan
soil, Air Force One and it's occupants
will be allowed safe passage to
Switzerland. You have one hour before
we start killing hostages.
The phone clicks off. A silent beat in the room.
V.P. CHANDLER
Find that voice for me, I want to
know who we're dealing with. And get
President Petrov on the phone.
GENERAL CHARLES GREELY, head of the 87th Mechanized Air Wing,
the unit responsible for Air Force One, enters the room.
GENERAL GREELY
Madame Vice-President, we just got
word from Ramstein... The nod was
UntiL Chandler stands.
V.P. CHANDLER
Empty?
GENERAL GREELY
The President... he must still be
onboard.
V.P. CHANDLER
Play back that call.
TECHNICAL OFFICER
Yes, sir.
The Tech Officer indexes back on his computer.
KORSHUNOV (V.0. TAPE)
The plane is under our command, and
those we did not kill we hold as
hostages, including the Chief of
Staff, the First Lady, and the First
Daughter.
V.P. CHANDLER
but not the President. Not the
President.
A silent beat.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
He's dead then. They must have killed
him.
DEAN
We don't know that.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
Holding the president hostage is not
something that slips your mind when
you're making demands.
V.P. CHANDLER
And if he's dead? Do you really think
they'd risk telling us?
DEAN
There is a possibility we're
overlooking.
All eyes turn to Dean.
DEAN
When I ran Specops in `Nam, I ordered
the destruction of a V.C. munitions
dump. During insertion, the plane
was shot down and the entire team
was killed, or so we thought. Two
days later the dump
BLEW AND A WEEK AFTER THAT, THIS 19-
year-old kid, the pilot... he walks out of the jungle in
pretty bad shape. He survived the crash and finished the
mission... alone.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
Walter, if you have a point, make
it.
DEAN
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
Most of the President's service record makes for dull reading
because most of what he did iarLZ ULirn. History remembers
him for what he did aflar he got back to the states -- the
protests, the rallies -- But he was a soldier once, a damn
fine one.
V.P. CHANDLER
So what are you saying?
DEAN
Maybe he's alive on that plane and
those bastards don't even know it.
V.P. CHANDLER
Mr. Dean, may I remind you that the
President is not 19 anymore.
INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
Marshall cautiously enters the room. Ready for action.
The room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight.
The sound of voices... coming from the Duke game which still
plays. Marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones.
It's dead. He tries the regular phone. Dead. Hangs it up in
disgust.
MARSHALL
Goddamnit.
He steps on some glass. It's a broken frame holding a
PHOTOGRAPH of Alice and Rose. He picks up the photo and lays
it on a table.
He thinks for a beat... glances around the room, searching...
Then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling
through his wardrobe.
INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.
Caldwell stands on the conference table. The hostages have
removed one of the ceiling panels. Air supply ducts and
bundles of wiring run through the ten-inch space between the
ceiling and the shielding plates.
MAJOR CALDWELL
This is a dead end.
Rose looks around the room. Hopeless. Her eyes land on the
carpet...
INT. CORRIDOR.
Marshall opens the stateroom door and slowly slides into the
corridor.
Vlad still faces the opposite direction.
Marshall creeps down the hallway, when...
Beep... Beep... Beep...
Marshall's watch alarm goes off.
Marshall dives for the nearest doorway. Vlad swings round to
see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin.
Vlad, unsure of what he saw., cautiously heads toward the
staff cabin. As he nears, he bends over a dead Secret Service
agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening
watch. It wasn't Marshall's after all. No matter. Vlad
continues to the staff Cabin.
INT. STAFF CABIN - NIGHT
Marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a
weapon. In the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and
phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of
the walls.
Marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing...
A fully stocked MEDICAL CENTER... fold-down operating
table... high-intensity lights. Equipped to deal with any
medical emergency the president might encounter.
But too late. Vlad kicks the door open.
VLAD
Get on the floor, now!
Marshall yanks down the operating table, and it smashes into
Vlad, knocking him down. Marshall lunges with his knife, but
Vlad OPENS FIRE. A HALF DOZEN ROUNDS pump into Marshall's
belly. He's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the
floor.
Vlad approaches the crumpled body. Leans down to examine his
victim. He cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his
head. Recognizes him.
VIAD
(wonderment)
The President.
But Marshall's eyes flash open.
MARSHALL
That's right, asshole.
He springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket
and into Vlad's spleen. Vlad freezes, unsure of what just
happened.
Marshall is on his feet. Never letting go of the twisting
knife, he grabs Vlad by the back of the head and slams his
face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. The
mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's
face. The blood drips down into the white porcelain sink,
swirling into the drain.
Vlad elbows Marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily.
He wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits Marshall
with a devastating right cross. Marshall reels back against
the wall, and Vlad follows, shoving the MP5 into Marshall's
throat. Marshall grabs the gun near the trigger...
* VLAD
Don't move or I'll blow your head off.
MARSHALL
I don't think so.
Marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his
forefinger, then knees Vlad in the balls. Viad pulls the
trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens.
Instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against Marshall's
face. Like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks Marshall into
the medical closet. The gun goes flying, skittering
UNDERNEATH A CABINET.
Marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his
legs from buckling. Vlad grabs some I.V. tubing and wraps it
around Marshall's neck. Marshall struggles for breath, clawing
at the tube.
HE SPOTS A DEFIBRILLATOR, REACHES AND SWITCHES IT ON. LOW-
pitched hum and beeping.
Marshall pulls his head forward, straining against the plastic
tubing. Then slams back into Vlad's head. Viad releases his
grip just for a moment...
The beeping becomes a steady whine.
... but a moment is all Marshall needs as he grabs the def
ib's CARDIAC PADDLES, turns, and SLAMS them on either side
of Vlad's head.
Vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds... his
eyeballs roll, his hair stands on end. then he collapses to
the floor.
MARSHALL
Clear.
Marshall catches his breath for a moment. Pulls open his
shirt. Beneath it he wears a bulletproof Kevlar vest. He
lifts the vest and a half-dozen angry welts have blossomed
across his skin. The stuff may be bulletproof, but each of
Vlad's shots sting like a motherfucker.
EXT. CORRIDOR.
Nevsky walks down the corridor. Sees that Vlad is away from
his post.
NEVSKY
Viad?
* INT. STAFF CABIN.
Marshall opens the medical cabinets, rifling through them.
Pulls out hypodermics, adrenalin, rubbing alcohol... arming
himself.
NEVSKY (O.S.)
Vlad? Vlad?
EXT. CORRIDOR.
Nevsky works his way up the corridor, peeking in rooms.
As he enters the...
INT. STAFF CABIN.
he's blinded by the high intensity surgical lights.
Marshall cracks a tank of anesthesia across Nevsky's heu
Nevsky goes down.
Marshall rips Nevsky's MP5 off of him. Holds it to Nevsky's
throat.
MARSHALL
Where are th*y? fly tamily, the
crew.... where are they?
Nevsky says nothing.
The conference room, right? Right?
Marshall jerks him to his feet.
MARSHALL
o'11 unlocli the door for me or I'll
kill you.
INT. CORRIDOR -
Marshall walks flevsky toward the mj vonteronve room3 As
they pass the stairs to the upper deck, Nevsky breaks away.
NEVSKY
KORSKUNOV!
Marshall fires. Killing him.
SHIT1
INT. CORRIDOR.
No time for remorse. Marshall tries the Main conference Room
door. Locked. He knows the others will be coming so he
flattens himself against the corridor wall. Trains his gun
on the stairs.
Just as the terrorists descend, Marshall squeezes off a few
rounds. The terrorists edge back up the steps, returning
fire.
Marshall checks his clip, not many bullets left. He fires
off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the
corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some
gauze.
The terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the
stairs to take position.
Marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made Molatov
cocktail and throws it down the corridor. The bottle crashes
into a BALL OF FLAME. Catching Bazylev on fire. He yells,
drops and rolls. FIRE SUPPRESSING FOAM immediately sprays
down from overhead.
KORSHUNOV
Go after him.
Serge hops Bazylev's burning body and heads down the corridor,
looking for this new wildcard. Korshunov grabs a fire
extinguisher from the galley and attends to Bazylev.
INT. CORRIDOR, TOWARD THE REAR OF AIR FORCE ONE.
Marshall retreats behind a divider. Sees Serge coming. Fires
a few rounds, then retreats to the next divider. Working
toward the rear of the plane.
Serge picks his way through the rear cabins, advancing
cautiously.
INT. REAR GALLEY/BATHROOMS.
Marshall's out of plane. Nowhere to hide in the galley.
Marshall eyes the bathrooms, doors flapping.
FOLLOWING SERGE...
as he reaches the rear galley and bathrooms. Marshall is
nowhere to be seen. But the bathroom doors are all closed.
SERGE
I know you're in there. Come on out.
(a few beats)
Okay. Have it your way.
Time for a deadly version of the shell game. serge fires
several rounds into the first closed bathroom door. The
bullets slice easily through the thin doors. He kicks the
riddled door open. The stall is empty.
Serge moves to the next one. Same procedure. It's empty.
Moves to the last bathroom, confident he's got him. He wails
with his MP5, turning the hatch into swiss cheese. Waits a
beat, then...
Kicks it in. It's empty too.
Serge looks around. Where the hell is this guy?
KORSHUNOV (O.S.)
(calling down)
Serge?
Serge reluctantly returns to his group.
INT. LOWER GALLEY, BAGGAGE LEVEL -
Marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter,
breathing heavy. He slumps against the bulkhead and slides
down to the ground.
He takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his
head. He hefts the MP5, refamiliarizing himself with the
weight and texture of a gun. He checks the clip. Only a
handfull of rounds left. He slaps it back in and switches
from automatic fire to single-shot then pantomimes firing.
MARSHALL
The NRA'll love this.
Looking down the barrel of the gun, he notices bins loaded
with luggage.
INT. OFFICE - NIGWR
Stoli Petrov on the phone, behind his large oak desk.
PETROV
I understand your dilemma, Vice
President Chandler. But unless you
can confirm that your President is
indeed a hostage, I cannot release
Stravanavitch. If Marshall is dead,
no good will come of meeting this
demand. We both know he would agree.
V.P. CHANDLER (V.0. PHONE)
But the First Lady...
PETROV
*.. is not a First Lady if her
husband's been killed. Then she's a
civilian. And I can't release him
for a civilian. Do you see my point?
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Each member of the crisis team is either on the phone or
huddled with staff. A secure fax machine spits out papers
which Lee slips into files.
Lee interrupts Chandler on the phone.
LEE
Madame Vice president. We have an
options paper. chandler takes the
options paper, waves off Lee, and
reads it as she talks.
V.P. CHANDLER
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
PETROV (V.0.)
But I will deploy forces to a staging
area near the Turkmenistan border.
When you have more information, we
can decide how to proceed.
V.P. CHANDLER
By then I'll be President.
Chandler hangs up the phone.
V.P. CHANDLER
(of f options paper)
I don't like any of these. from, did
you brief General Northwood?
Northwood pops out of his huddle.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
I'M INCLINED TO TRY THIS PART -
Anticipate their landing site and get strike teams in place.
V.P. CHANDLER
Can we do that?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
We've got four hours before they
make it into Turkienistan airspace.
I've got a satellite passing overhead in twenty minutes. We
can narrow down the landing site choices based on runway
length and any unusual activity. With luck we'll only have
to capture three or four sites.
V.P. CHANDLER
But they start executing hostages in
FORTY FIVE MINUTES. -
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
I hate to be pragmatic, but they'll
sacrifice pawns before kings. It may
take them some time to kill their
way up to senior staff.
V.P. CHANDLER
Okay. Also, I want you to put our
bases in Turkey on alert, and have
the Kitty Hawk prepare a retaliatory
air strike.
* DEAN
Madame Vice-President...
V.P. CHANDLER
I've not discounted your theory Hr.
Dean...
DEAN
No... I got the new numbers from our
gamers. They believe that there's
only an eight percent chance that
the President is still alive.
V.P. CHANDLER
Eight percent is better than zero.
Oh shit... what is that?
Chandler refers to a monitor in the rear of the room.
CNN, the omnipresent player on the world political stage,
broadcasts video from Ramstein Air Base.
GENERAL GREELY
That's trouble.
CNN REPORTER (V.0. T.V.)
*.. the Presidential Aircraft was enroute from Moscow when
it began its mayday hail. But in a startling turn of events,
the seemingly out of control plane aborted its landing and
took off again. We haven't been able to confirm its status
or whether or not the first family was onboard at the time.
V.P. CHANDLER
Would someone get the Press Secretary!
AIDE
He's been holding on line four.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
Air Force One, lit up by moonlight.
INT. CORRIDOR.
The fire is extinguished. Zedeck squats over Nevsky's body.
Gibbs and Serge maintain a defensive position, guns ready.
Bazylev emerges from the Senior staff Conference room. He
shakes his head ""no"". Korshunov nods and furrows his brow.
KORSHUNOV
Who did this?
GIBBS
We checked the manifest. Everyone
was accounted for.
KORSHUNOV
A secret service agent. It must be.
Wounded but alive. Serge, Bazylev...
Find him.
Serge and Bazylev lock and load, head off in separate
directions.
KORSHUNOV
The conference room is no longer
secure. We'll take the First Lady
and the girl up top where we can
keep a closer eye on them.
INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -
The hostages have torn up a section of carpeting. Caidwell
and Shepherd examine the floor. Smooth sheets of steel riveted
together. Pointless.
MAJOR CAL DWELL
We're not getting out that way.
The door swings open and Gibbs and Korshunov enter. They
spots the ripped up carpeting.
KORSHUNOV
Admirable, but you're wasting your
time.
(beat)
Mrs. Marshall, would you and your
daughter please come here.
They don't move. Korshunov raises his gun, points it a
Shepherd's head.
KORSHUNOV
Now, or he dies, please.
ROSE
Come on, Alice.
ALICE
I'm scared.
Doherty steps forward. Shepherd tries to pull him back, to
no
* avail.
DOHERTY
You've got the better part of the
White House locked in this room, you
know. If you want to negotiate, we're
the ones to do it with.
Korshunov SHOOTS Doherty through the head. Screams from some
of the hostages. Korshunov squeezes off a few shots to quiet
everyone.
KORSHUNOV
Mrs. Marshall. Alice. If you please.
Rose turns to the other hostages.
ROSE
It's okay. Do what you're told. It's
okay. We'll be okay.
She locks eyes with Caldwell. HKeep working.N He nods.
INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -
The President hunts through luggage. Overturned garment bags
and suitcases around him, belongings littered all over the
bulkhead. He sifts through heaps of clothing and finally
recovers what he's been looking for...
A CELLULAR PHONE...
He flips it open, starts to dial... but freezes.
MARSHALL
Goddamnit.
He can't remember the number. He dials...
CLOSE.ON PHONE -555-1212... Information.
The phone rings...
INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE HOLD.
Bazylev, moving like a commando, slowly and methodically
works his way into the lower galley.
INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -
Marshall. Finally, the phone picks up.
VOICE (O.S. PHONE)
Information. How can I assist you?
MARSHALL
Washington D.C.?
VOICE
Yes, sir. Can I help you?
MARSHALL
Yes, the number for the White House.
INT. PILOT'S REST AREA - NIGHT
The rest area consists of a couple of bunks behind the
cockpit area, still soiled black from the earlier C-4
explosion. Korshunov pours a cup of coffee and offers it to
Alice.
ALICE
I don't drink coffee.
KORSHUNOV
You must be tired. It'll wake you
up.
ALICE
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
Gibbs wraps Rose's hands behind her back with duct tape.
ROSE
Leave my daughter alone.
KORSHUNOV
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?
(beat, he chuckles)
But I admire your courage. Your
husband, on the other hand...
ROSE
What do you know of my husband?
KORSHUNOV
I know he left you behind.
ROSE
My husband is a very courageous man.
KORSHUNOV
Your husband is a coward. He sends
soldiers half-way around the world
to steal a man from his home in the
middle of the night.
Alice sits up, attentive.
ALICE
You're one of Stravanavitch's men.
KORSHUNOV
So, you study world events, little
one. That's good for a girl your
age.
ALICE
Yeah, I study world events. Five
thousand Turkienistan Muslims were
slaughtered in Stravanvitch's
cleansings... along with 15 American
school kids. You know hQw I studied
that. I went to their funerals with
my dad. I met their parents.
KORSHUNOV
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your
class? Tell me, do you know what the
word ""propaganda"" means?
ALICE
Yeah. Do you know what the word
""asshole"" means.
ROSE
Alice!
Rose doesn't know whether to be pissed at Alice or proud of
her. Korshunov smiles, nods his head and lifts his gun.
KORSHUNOV
Yes, I have heard that word.
He aims his gun at Alice.
KORSHUNOV
Yes, I am an asshole.
A long beat, the Korshunov lovers the gun.
KORSHUNOV
Your father is a reasonable man.
Once he hears our simple demand, I'm sure he will acquiesce.
For your sake.
Korshunov smiles. Gibbs grabs Alice's hands and pulls them
behind her back. Begins wrapping them with the tape.
INT. MAIN CABING, REAR GALLEY.
Serge searches through the galley cabinets, spots the galley
dumbwaiter. Now he knows where his quarry went.
He angrily grabs a service cart and shoves it into the
dumbwaiter, disabling it.
INT. GANGWAY -
Bazylev hears the beeps of a phone dialing. He moves toward
the aft portal of the gangway.
INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -
Marshall waits as the phone rings...
INT. WHITE HOUSE, SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
A chipper woman in her mid-20s picks up the call.
SWITCHBOARD
White House switchboard. How may I
direct your call.
MT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -
MARSHALL
(hushed urgency)
Okay listen, listen carefully. This
is an emergency call from Air Force
One. Who's there? Is the Vice-
President there?
INT. WHITE HOUSE, SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
SWITCHBOARD
who can I say is calling?
MARSHALL (0.S. PHONE)
This is the President.
SWITCHBOARD
Yeah, right.
MARSHALL
Don't cut me off. This is an
emergency.
SWITCHBOARD
Sir, the President does not call
this particular number. So whoever
you are get a life, before I have
this call traced.
MARSHALL
You don't understand. This is an
emergency. Let me talk to anyone.
The switchboard operator thinks for a moment. Maybe she can
have some fun with this nutcase.
SWITCHBOARD
Okay... if you're the President,
when's your wife's birthday?
MARSHALL
Look lady, I don't have time for
games. Just put the....
SWITCHBOARD
Thank you for calling the white
House...
INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -
MARSHALL
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
Bazylev appears behind Marshall. Raises his gun.
MARSHALL
I should know this.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD ROOM -
MARSHALL (V.0.)
It's June.
Gunfire in the background.
SWITCHBOARD
Sir? Are you there? Sir? Sir?
Her face says N. The Switchboard operator pulls out a call
sheet and finds a number.
INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -
On the phone, lying open on a heap of clothing.
Bazylev points the machine gun at Marshall's head.
BAZ YLEV
Hands away from your weapon.
Marshall doesn't move, his np5 hanging at his waist... his
hand inches from it.
BAZYLEV
Come now. You don't want to die.
Marshall... with no options... slowly moves his hands away
from the gun.
BAZYLEV
On your knees...
PHONE (O.S.)
Hello. Is anyone there?
Bazylev motions Marshall to get on his knees. Marshall
complies.
BAZYUV
What's that in your shirt? Open it.
Marshall pulls his shirt aside revealing his Kevlar vest.
BAZYLEV
Take it off. Now.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
Chandler on the phone. An aide waves, trying to get her
attention.
V.P. CHANDLER
My intention is not to escalate the
situation, but it's a contigency
that must be considered. Hang on...
(to Aide)
What?
AIDE
The switchboard says that someone
called in claiming to be the
President, then she heard gunfire.
Caller's gone, but the line's still active.
DEAN
Could be some crank watching CNN.
AIDE
No sir. Trace confirms the call is
Coming from a White House staff
cellular account.
V.P. CHANDLER
Put it through down here.
(into phone)
Hang on, Toni.
The call comes in on speaker phone, distorted muffled voices
and the whine of an aircraft in the background.
V.P. CHANDLER
What's going on in the background?
Can we hear what's going on?
Dean picks up a phone.
DEAN
Max, get me Willis.
INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, LISTENING POST - DAY
WILLIS, a grossly overweight man in his late forties
surrounded by a monolith of high-tech, starts working his
console.
WILLIS
Tracking... Intercepting call... Got
it. Ten seconds, Mr. Dean.
Audio waveforms appear over Willis' console. He implements
digital filtering routines, cleaning up the sounds.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY
The group listens intently. The call modulates, distorts,
dissolves... then clarifies.
BAZYLEV (V.0.)
Hands... hands behind your head, Mr.
President.
V.P. CHANDLER
It's him. He is alive.
BAZYLEV
I'm going to take your weapon now,
and then I'm going to take you
Upstairs to join the others.
Understand?
DEAN
Christ, they have him.
BAZYLEV
And if you make any sudden moves, I
will not hesitate to shoot.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
Maybe they don't have him yet.
Northwood stares up at the tactical board. Air Force One...
surrounded by the F-l5s.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
And maybe we aren't so helpless.
General Northwood picks up a secure phone and dials.
GENERAL NORTPNOOD
General Greely, Air Force One has
automatic countermeasures, right?
GENERAL GREELY
Everything we own is in that plane.
GENERAL NORTINOOD
So a single missile launched from a
distance should be a mere distraction.
GENERAL GREELY
Theoretically.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
(into phone)
Ramutein Tower Control, please.
GENERAL GREELY
(getting it)
But the effect could be jarring.
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
Exactly. Ramstein? General
Northwood... Patch me through to
your fighters. Madame Vice
President... with your permission?
V.P. CHANDLER
Do it.
INT. AFT STORAGE COMPARTMENT -
Marshall on his knees, hands behind his head. Bazylev, his
automatic pressed against Marshall's forehead, disarms
Marshall before stepping away. He slings Marshall's MP5 over
his own neck. Studies Marshall a beat.
BAZ YLEV
So you're the President. Somehow, I
thought you'd be smaller.
Marshall stares straight ahead tn silent defiance. Bazylev
kicks him in the gut. Marshall doubles over, wheezing.
BAZYLEV
Not so powerful now, eh? No aides to
advise you, no secret service to
protect you, no armies to command.
Bazylev grabs Marshall's hair and tugs his head back. He
holds Marshall with his eyes.
BAZYLEV
You'll suffer for what you've done.
MARSHALL
* So will you.
Bazylev slams Marshall's face against his knee. Marshall
slumps forward.
BAZYLEV
Up. Get up now!
Marshall slowly rises to his feet. Bazylev swings wide around
him.
BAZYLEV
You will walk ahead... slowly. Do
you understand?
(no response)
Do you understand!
MARSHALL
Do you know what's going to happen
to you because of this? Do you know
what the world will do?
BAZYLEV

INT. AIR FORCE ONE COCKPIT - NIGHT
Zedeck monitoring the controls. Situation normal. Then all
hell breaks loose as an entire wall of instrumentation lights
up. Warning bells. Flashing lights.
ZEDECK
What is this?
The TACTICAL COUNTERMEASUREs COMPUTER - Springs to life.
High-tech readouts, risk analyses, schematics, and
assessments. Radar tracks the incoming, identifies it.

Out the cockpit window, the brightly burning tail of the

The shock wave hits the aircraft.
Lights flicker and the plane rocks side to side.
HOSTAGES are bounced around the conference room.
INT. GANGWAY -
Marshall and Bazylev are slammed against the ceiling and
then the floor.
Marshall seizes the moment. Grabs Bazylev's gun. The two
struggle and Bazylez instinctively pulls the trigger. A burst
of richocheting gunfire sparks across the bulkhead.
The turbulence worsens. Bazylev manages to wrest away the
rifle, but the plane pulls into a climb, sending Bazylev
tumbling down the gangway into the rear baggage hold.
Marshall manages to pull himself up the grating and into the
galley. He's free, for the moment.
INT. AFO, COCKPIT.
Gibbs steadies the plane as the shock wave from the explosion
* subsides.
GIBBS
We're okay.
Korshunov examines the Tactical Countermeasures Computer.
KORSHUNOV
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
GIBBS
why did they do that?
KORSHUNOV
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve
us.
GIBBS
Well it worked.
Korshunov smiles and puts his hand on Gibbs shoulder.
KORSHUNOV
Relax, my friend. Apparently they
cannot harm us. Even if they wanted
to. rNT. FRONT GALLEY.

Marshall Struggles to assemble the hypodermic and the
container of adrenalin.
INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD.
Bazylev pulls to his feet, heads back down the gangway.
INT. FRONT GALLEY.
Marshall greets Bazylev with a spray of hot coffee from the
Simmering pot as he enters. Bazylev covers up, but the spray
sears him pretty bad. He yells in pain, turning.
Marshall springs, imbedding the hypodermic needle into
Bazylev's neck. A full dose of adrenalin. Bazylev pulls the
empty needle from his neck. Marshall steps back, waiting for
a reaction.
A pregnant pause as they both wait to see what happens.
Then Bazylev smiles and slowly turns toward Marshall.
Marshall backs away as Bazylev levels his gun.
He fires once, hitting Marshall in the arm. Marshall winces
off the pain.
BAZYLEV
(disgust)
The leader of the free world.
He backs Marshall against a wall and holds him in his sights.
But he doesn't shoot. His breathing becomes faster and faster
as the adrenalin takes hold. Building... building... He
screams and clutches at his throat.
His eyes spin back and then his heart explodes.
Bazylev is caught frozen, suspended in a moment of disbelief.
Death reflex. He fires off several rounds from the gun as he
collapses.
Marshall waits a beat, half-expecting Bazylev to rise. He
slowly approaches the body and retrieves the KP5.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
The F-lSs pull back into formation around the Jumbo Jet.

Marshall rips his sleeve off, swabs the blood off his arm.
Bazylev's bullet took out a good chunk of flesh when it grazed
him.
MARSHALL
Did they say anything about my family?
V.P. CHANDLER
They're still alive, but the loyalists
plan to start killing hostages in
forty minutes.
MARSHALL
Then tell me there's a rescue
operation underway.
Marshall opens a travel bottle of Vodka and pours it over
the wound. He winces from the pain.
V.p CHANDLER 69.
I think we're okay, sir. flow that we know You're alive we
can force Petrov to release Stravanavitch.
MARSpari Don't tell me you plan to give in to these fuckers.
GENERAL NORmwOOD We plan to do whatever it takes to keep you
alive, sir.
V.P. CHANDLER
and if that means negotiating...
MARSHALL
You know my policy. We don't negotiate
with terrorists. If we start now,
all of America becomes a target.
V.P. CHANDLER
But this is different, sir. You're
the President.
* MARSHALL
And what happens when Stravanavitch is freed and discovers
he's got the President? You think for a second that that
crazy bastard is just gonna turn me over? He'll ask for the
goddamn moon before he's done.
V.P. CHANDLER
Please, Mr. President. You're going
to get yourself killed. Is that your
solution?
MARSHALL
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get
tens of thousands killed. I can't
live with that.
(somewhat resigned)
I'm not royalty. I'm an elected
official and the integrity of the
office of the President is infinitely
more important than the man who holds
that office.
(beat)
We don't negotitate. Not as long as
I'm President. Is that understood?
A long silence, then...
YES SIR. CHANDLER
MARSHALL
flow, is there a rescue operation
under way or not?
Lee shakes his head at Chandler, signalling ""don't tell.""
LEE
He's not on a secure line.
MARSHAlj Whoever said that, shut up. Walter, are you there?
DEAN
I'm here, Mr. President.
MARSHALL
Where's the cavalry?
DEAN
We can't do anything until that plane
lands. And when it does land, sir,
it's going to be in hostile *
territory. To be perfectly honest,
we don't know what the hell to do.
It's going to take a miracle to figure this one out.
A long beat. We hold on Marshall's determined face.
MARSHALL
I'll see what I can do.

Serge comes across Bazylev. Checks for any sign of life.
Stone cold dead. He looks around and grips his gun a little
tighter as he backs out of the room.

Marshall sees that the stairway hatch has been sealed.

Marshall hits the button for the dumbwaiter. The dumbwaiter
begins to descend then snags on the service cart. Its motor
grind to a halt. Marshall slumps dQwn. His hopes dashed.
Nothing to do now but wait.

Serge looks over the crowd of hostages like a bouncer at a
hip dance club. His eyes fall on Maria Mitchell.
SERGE
You. Come with me.
INT. LOWER GALLEY.
Marshall, seated on the floor. The cabinet next to him is
stacked with packs of complimentary cigarettes, all with the
seal of the President.
MARSHALL
What the hell...
He opens up a pack and puts the cigarette in his mouth. He
snags one of the Presidential lighters, tries to light it
several times but it only sparks. XC shakes it. It's out of
tial. He tosses it aside and reaches for a book of matches,
but he FREEZES in mid-reach. A thought occurs to him.
MARSHALL
(murmuring)
Out of fuel.
INT. FORWARD BAGAGE HOLD - NIGHT
Marshall, lacking a screwdriver, levers open the hatch to
the Avionics compartment with the barrel of his gun.

He searches up and down.

Marshall halts his search to listen.
MITCHELL (V.0.)
I'm responsible for Press Relations
for the Flight Office.
KORSHUNOV (V.0.)
How are your fellow hostages feeling,
Ms. Mitchell?
MITCHELL
Scared. We're scared.
INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT
Rose cradles Alice, both of them looking away, as Korshunov
raises his gun, pointing it at Mitchell.
KORSHUNOV
And why are you scared?
MITCHEL*L
Because... because I don't want to
die.
INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.
The hostages, listening.
KORSHUNOV
And what am I doing at this very

Marshall listens, helpless to do anything.
MITCHELL
You're pointing a gun at me.

KORSHUNOV
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Did you hear her? She said I'm pointing a gun at her.
INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT -
KORSHUNOV
Now, to the secret service agent in

seconds to surrender, or this women
will die.
Marshall's eyes widen.

Tears stream down Maria Mitchell's face. She's trying so
hard to be brave in front of Rose and Alice.
KORSHUNOV

For Marshall, this is the hardest decision of his life. His
face a mask of anguish as he wrestles with his conscience.

Korshunov looking down the barrel of the gun.
KORSHUNOV
Nine...

It takes every bit of training and will to stop Marshall
from going up those stairs. He knows what's going to happen.
He closes his eyes tight as if that will stop it from
happening.

A long silent beat. Then... BAAAAM!

Marshall sinks to to his knees.

fills the room.

Marshall, silhouetted in the half light, craddles his head
head in his hands. The shaft of light disappears as the main
cabin hatch closes, sealing him off once again.
KORSFL3NOV (V.0.)

about that one and then we'll try
again. Perhaps soon I will choose
somebody important.

zedeck and Serge drag the dead woman out of the compartment.
Alice sobs quietly.
ROSE
Do you have to be so brutal?

Why? Do you enjoy it?
KORSHUNOV
I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do
what is necessary.
ROSE
How can you? I mean they're people.

KORSHUNOV
But they are not ny people. You look
at me as if I am a monster, but answer
me this -- when your planes bombed
the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry
for those dark skinned men whose
names you do not know and who's faces
You will never see? Did You cry for
their wives and children. They were
people too, yes... but they were not
your people.
ROSE
That was war.
KORSHUNOV
So is this.

Come now, you're upsetting the little

The woman you shot. She was my friend.
KORSHUNOV
That's the way of the world, little

The Chief Mechanic has Air Force One schematics open in front
of him. He and his staff are huddled around them.
CHIEF MECHANIC
Do you see the maintenance panel?
MARSHALL
Got it.
CHIEF MECHANIC
Pop it open. There should be a red
switch, toggle it up.
MARSHALL
Okay, it's on. We've got some
indicator lights here.
CHIEF MECHANIC
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the
fuel you have to close the circuit
for the pump. There's no switch in
Avionics so you'll have to cross the
wires. There should be five wires,
just to your left. Do you see them?
INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
Marshall finds the wires: red, white, blue, green and yellow.
MARSHALL
Got `en.
Static blankets the conversation.
CHIEF MECHANIC
Okay, hang on. Let me double check
here, because if you get the wrong ones, you'll cut the engine
feeds and stall the plane.
MARSHALL
I'll wait.
The static worsens.
CHIEF MECHANIC
First... cut... green wire.
Marshall, Using a kitchen knife, slices the green wire. Heavy
static. The phone beeps... lOsing batteries.
MARSHALL
It's cut.
CHIEF MECHANIC
cross it... The static overwhelms
the voice, then cuts out.
MARSHALR'
Hello? Hello? Goddamnit.
Static comes roaring back and garbled voices...
MARSHAlj Hello? Are YOU there?
Dead. Marshall tries to activate it again.
MARSHAIJi Hello? Hello?
Nothing. He tosses the dead phone aside.
Marshall stares. Cross the green wires with the... what?
Red, white, blue... or the yellow. His choice is obvious. He
cuts the yellow wire and crosses it with the green, leaving
the red, white and blue standing.
He waits. The engines continue to groan. He allows himself a
smile.
MARSHALL
An emergency landing in friendly
territory... there's your goddamn
miracle.
EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Beneath the plane a trickle of gasoline appears and grows
into a strong steady stream.

A red warning light flashes on the plane's panel.
GIBBS
Goddamnit it. We're losing fuel.
Korshunov crosses to the flight deck.
KORSHUNOV
How?
GIBBS

place. You better get Zedeck down
there fast Unless, of course, you'd
rather be a martyr than a savior.
KORSHUNOV
(to Zedeck)
Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.
Zedeck nods and dashes out of the cabin.

Zedeck pulls open the hatch cover to the forward front stairs.
Descends into the dimly lit underneath.
Serge descends right behind Zedeck.
INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
Zedeck, Spooked by the dark shadows, senses he's being
watched.
ZEDECK
He's down here. I can feel it.
SERGE
Shut up and do your job.
Zedeck hastens toward the Avionics compartment, gun at the
ready. Serge sweeps the area behind.
They hear a metallic clank echo and reverberate around him.
They both check left... right... behind them...
Nothing.
It's creepy being a walking target.
From behind a water storage tank, Marshall watches down the
barrel of his Mp5. With all the equipment in the way, it's
almost impossible to line up a clear shot.
And they're both well armed. He looks toward the stairway
instead.
Zedeck enters the Avionics compartment. Serge takes a
defensive position outside the door.
ZEDECK (O.S.)
The valve is shut. This guy sure
knew what he was doing.
Serge hears a noise and opens tire.

Not even close. Hell, we can't even
make Syria or Iraq.
KORSHUNOV

Lee whispers to the Vice President.
LEE
Finally, we can bargain.
V.P. CHANDLER
I'm sure we can strike some sort of
arrangement. Land the plane and we'll
trade you hostages for fuel.
KORSHUNOV
No. The plane lands when I say, or
it will crash. The hostages are
released when I say, or they will
die.
INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.
KORSHUNOV
Tell me what I want to hear or I
will execute a member of the senior
staff, and will continue killing one
hostage every minute until we crash
or until a refueling plane arrives.
Murmuring and hushed discussion floats over the airwaves.
A long silence. Korshunov looks toward Alice.
KORSHUNOV
Shall I begin by executing the
President's daughter? She's right
here.
ROSE
No.
KORSHUNOV

ZEDECK

more fuel.
KORSHUNOV
He's already killed three of us, and
we haven't even seen him. He's also
shown that he can hurt us. I need to
think.

What the hell are you doing up here?
Get back to the conference room.

Serge takes his position by the conference room.
Across from him, against the cabin divider, Marshall peers
down the sight of his gun.
Serge freezes.

Serge raises his hands. Marshall reaches over and pulls out
the clip to his MP5.
MARSHALL
Open the door.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
Caldwell, Shepherd and a few other aides hear the key turn
in the lock. They quickly take position around the door. As
Marshall marches Serge in, they're both tackled and smothered
by the group. They wrest the guns away and shut the door
quickly behind them.
Marshall struggles against his people.
MARSHALL
It's me goddamnit. Let me go.
Surprised to hear their boss' voice, the aides and advisors
release Marshall.
SHEPHERD
Mr. President, how the hell did you
get on board?
MARSHALL
I never left. Where's my wife and
daughter?
MAJOR CALDWELL
They took `em out. They're probably
on the upper deck.
SHEPHERD
Mr. President, Major Caldwell here
has a plan to get these hostages of
f the plane.
MARSHALL
I dumped most of the fuel. They'll
land soon and Delta will take its
shot.
SERGE
A refueling plane is already on it's
way so we won't be landing until we
reach Turkmenistan. Your best course
of action is to release me. I will
be merciful.
MAJOR CALDWELL 84.
Sir, maybe we can use this. Turn it to our advantage.
MARSHALL
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few
miles away. How do you propose getting
us from here to there?
MAJOR CALDWELL

There's no turning back.
MAJOR CALDWELL
We can't jump from here or at this
speed. But if we could get a message
out - tell the refueling plane...
MARSHALL
They've cut communication, and I
spent a good bit of time looking for
alternatives. My only solution ran
out of batteries.

MARSHALL
Excuse me?

MARSHALL
(dismissive)
No good. I said they disabled the

SECRETARY
No. I thought about this, Mr.

different systems of encryption. It'd be easy to overlook
the data systems.
What do they have to lose?
MARSHALL

He signs the paper and hands it toher. She slides it into
the machine, checks the listed numbers and dials.
MARSHALL
Someone should give you a raise.
SECRETARY
Actually, sir, you could be that
someone.
They wait... will it work? A few beats, a few beats more.
The machine pulls the paper in and begins scanning.
MARSHALL
It's yours.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM.
Marshall's note spits out of one of the fax machines. But in
the bevy of activity, will it be noticed?
INT. UNDERDECK, REAR LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT
Caldwell spins open the rear emergency pressure door and
leads the hostages into...
INT. TAILCONE PARACHUTE LAUNCH PLATFORM -
A cargo hold extending up the tapered edge of the aircraft's
rear. The hostages begin pulling parachute packs out of the
overhead storage bins. Helping each other.
INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM.
Korshunov listens to Zedeck yell into the phone in Russian.
ZEDECK
Still no movement on Stravanavitch.
Korshunov eyes Alice and Rose.
ROSE
Nor will there be. My husband does
not negotiate with terrorists.
KORSHUNOV
You will be the first to pay for
that mistake.
INT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP.
Caidwell assists everyone in strapping on their packs. He
addresses one group, mostly women and senior staff, who belt
into the larger chutes.
MAJOR CALDWELL
These chutes are designed for a safe
slow descent. They'll deploy off the
line automatically as you step from
the plane.
(turns to another
group, mostly younger
men)
You guys'll have to pull your own
rip cords. Wait until you're clear
from the plane, but not any longer.
(he checks packs and
straps)
Once I check you, go stand behind
the yellow line. You're good. You're
good. You're good.
Two neat lines ready to jump. One line on the deployment
wire, and the other set for freefall.
Marshall and the secretary arrive.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Mr. president? pwtsHALL The fax
went through. We can only wait.
MAJOR CAWWELL
Your chute.
MARSHALL
I'll not going without my family.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Yes, sir.
Caidwell crosses to prep the Launch Ramp controls.

Through the cockpit Window, the long metallic appendage
dangles ahead of the plane.

Marshall indicates the four men without parachutes on. TWO
AIR FORCE CREW MEMBERS, Major Caldwell and Shepherd.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Sir, we stay with the President.
MARSHALL
That isn't necessary.
None of them changes his mind.
MARSHALL

Marshall smiles.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
The KC-135 flies above Air Force One, connected by a gasoline
umbilical cord.
INT. EMERGENCY RAMP PLATFORM.
Caldwell breaks safety glass. Reaches into a compartment and
pulls a lever.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Here we go.
A mechanical him and clank gives way to a rush of wind as
the tail section of Air Force One hinges open on hydraulic
struts, extending like a plank behind the plane. We can see
the sky with its angry clouds.
Rushing by at two hundred knots.
INT. FLIGHT DECK.
A LOUD BUZZ
KORSHUNOV
What's that?
A warning light flashes on the control panel. Tactical Video
Display shows the emergency parachute ramp activating.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM.
Radio traffic echos through the room.
COL. CMLTON (V.0.)
We got... okay... so far ten chutes
deploying of f the line. Dropping
signal flares for search and rescue.
INT. ITEAR BAGGAGE HOLD -
Zedeck reaches the emergency pressure door. Through the
porthole he sees the hostages getting away. He tries the
door hatch. Locked.
Zedeck looks around. Crosses to the lower rear galley.
He kicks open the panel on the stove. Rips out the propane
tank. He runs back and wedges the tank into the door lock.
He backs off 50 feet, turns and opens fire on the tank.
The tank explodes, blowing the door out.
EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH PLATFORM
The pressure door blows open and an explosion of pressurized
air blasts through the platform.
The remaining parachutists are blown out the rear. Chutes
deploying.
Marshall and Serge are knocked down the ramp, tumbling toward
oblivion. Just as Marshall's about to slide off the corner
of the ramp he grabs its hydraulic strut.
Plummeting death.
His grip is all that separates his dangling body from a long
Serge tumbles by Marshall, limbs flailing, and with a scream
Woven from a thousand nightma5, he loses his grip and slides
off the ramp into the jetblack sky, falling endlessly.
Shepherd and Caldwell manage to hang to safety webbing as
the
wind whips around them. The two other air force crew members
Without chutes also manage to hang on.
As the plane depressurizes, it BUCKS like a wild bronco.
Marshall looks down into the sky. Below his dangling legs,
parachutes blossoij. He's straining... he can't hold on
forever.
INT. COCKPIT -
Gibbs fights the wheel.
Oxygen masks spring out from an overhead compartment as air
is sucked out of the cockpit...
The plane shudders and jumps badly....
KC-135 PILOT (V.0. RADIO)
Air Force One, back off. I repeat, back off.
Gibbs wrestles with the yoke, to no avail.
GIBBS
She's bucking. I can't hold her!
KC-135 PILOT (V.0. RADIO)
What are you doing? Back off! Back off!
EXT. SKY -
Air Force One jerks upward, snapping off the fueling arm of
the KC-135.
KC-135 PILOT
LOOK OUT!
The broken edge of the fueling arm scrapes along the top of
Air Force One... metal against metal... tearing a gash in
the plane... Sparks fly.
ONE OF THE SPARKS
ignites the river of gasoline being pumped from the refueling
craft's belly.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE, COCKPIT -
Gibbs Sees the fueling arm catch fire. It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to figure what's coming. The flames creep
up toward the gas tanks.
GIBBS
Holy Shiti Gibbs pushes the stick
down and Air Force One begins to
dive to safety.
EXT. SKY -
Air Force One descends.
Whipping fire trails the KC-135.
Slowly rolls it way into the plane's main tank.
A burning fuse.
BARRROOOOOOOM! A FIRECLOUD ERUPTS ACROSS THE SKY.
Sky like daylight.
From this incredible firecloud, the burned out skeleton of
an airplane emerges, falling toward earth.
The F-15 escort zoom toward the unexpected fireball.
COL. CARLTON
Everybody break. Now! Now! Now!
Carlton's planes go into emergency climb, standing on their
afterburners to escape the inferno.
INT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP -
Marshall hangs on to the strut for dear life as the
pressurized air swooshes by him, taking with it everything
that isn't nailed down including some of the spare parachutes.
Fire rains down from the heavens, the sky like one giant
napalm nightmare.
The shock wave hits the plane, slamming it violently.
Almost yanking the hyraulic arm from Marshall's grasp.
The military aides without parachutes lose their footing and
tumble off the platform. SCREAMING as they fall into fire.
EXT. SKY -
The burning KC-135 shell, an apocalyptic Flying Dutchman in
a vengeful Kamikazee dive at Air Force One.
It's gonna be close.
The flaming shell passes only a few hundred yards to the
rear of the 747.
EXT. PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP -
Marshall's got a great view. Flames dance in his eyes as he
watches the refueling plane descend.
The brightness subsides, and the sky grows dark again.
The wave of pressurized air subsides leaving Zedeck, Marshall,
Shepherd and Caldwell on the ramp. Caldwell begins edging
toward Marshall.
ZEDECK
Don't move.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Let me save him.
Marshall barely hangs on.
ZEDECK
That man, he is the president, no?
SHEPHERD
Yes. Yes he is.
Zedeck motions to Caidwell with his gun. ""Go get him.""
Caldwell crawls down the ramp and extends his hand to
Marshall.
THE PRESSURE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT -
zedeck leads Marshall, shepherd and Caldwell away.
IPRR. AFO'S FLIGHT DECK -
Gibbs steadies the plane.
KORSHUNOV
Fuel?
Gibbs checks the guages.
GIBBS
More than enough to get us home.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - EVENING
The sun begins to set along the Potomac in long streaks of
red and pink. The White House lights flicker on uminating
the long staunch columns, the pillars of democracy.
RNT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - EVENING
Tired. Strung out. Bickering within the small workgroups.
Chandler crosses to General Northwood, who has just hung up
the phone.
V.P. CHANDLER
They still have the President, it's
past their deadline and they haven't
called. What do you think it means?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
Like any good poker player, they're
checking over their hand seeing which
cards to play and which to discard.
INT. AFO, MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT
Zedeck leads the three hostage into the M.C.C.
Rose and Marshall - their eyes meet. Enormous relief for the
both of them. Marshall smiles at his wife, as she fights
back her tears.
ALICE
(to Korshunov)
He didn't leave us.
KORSHUNOV
You are a resilient man, Mr.
President.
Zedeck grabs Caldwell's hands and tapes them behind his back
with duct tape. Rose and Alice already have their hands taped.
KORSHUNQV
You must forgive the tape, but we
were starting to feel outnumbered...
Gibbs!
INT. FLIGHT DECK -
Gibbs puts the plane on automatic pilot. Rises to join the
group.
INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -
Korshunov separates Marshall from his family. Waves him into
the Com Officer's chair. His hands are now wrapped too.
Gibbs enters looking down.
MARSHALL
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do
this?
GIBBS
Yes, Mr. President.
MARSHALL
Why?
GIBBS
Because it is my duty.
MARSHALL
You're duty to what? The country you
served doesn't exist anymore.
GIBBS
My loyalty was never to my country.
I serve my commanding officers.
KORSHUNOV
You don't think the leaders of the
KGB would allow peristroika to ruin
years of infiltration? No, when the
Soviet Union collapsed, we took our
sleepers with us.
Korshunov holds up a telephone.
KORSHUNOV
Now since we've had very little luck
getting Washington or Moscow to
cooperate, I wondered if you would
be so kind.
MARSHALL
Over my dead body.
KORSHUNOV
No. But since I only have a few of
your staff left to kill, perhaps I
will start with your family instead...
Gibbs.
Gibbs grabs Alice and shoves her into a chair. She fights
him off, and he smacks her across the face and shoves his
gun into her neck.
Marshall and Rose struggle against their bonds.
KORSHUNOV
The world is such a dangerous place
and we can't always protect our
children.
ROSE
Please. You can kill me but leave my
daughter alone.
Korshunov runs his finger down Alice's cheek.
MARSHALL
She isn't a part of this. This is
between you and me.
KORSHUNOV
Call up Petrov and order
Stravanavitch' S release.
Marshall looks to Alice, then Rose, then back to Alice.
MARSHALL
This administration does not negotiate
with terrorists.
KORSHUNOV
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Gibbs withdraws his pistol. Places it against Alice's temple.
KORSHUNOV
Perhaps a President does not
negotiate, but does a father?
(beat)
An interesting choice. Your daughter
versus your world vision. The implicit
trust of a family against your oath
of office.
Tears of fears are streaming down Alice's face. She looks
into her father's eyes.
ALICE
Daddy...
MARSHALL
Alice... I...
KORSHUNOV
And once the trigger is pulled, she
is gone forever. Then, I wonder, how
do you live, knowing you could've
saved her?
Marshall struggles with his duty. His honor.
KORSHUNOV
And could you ever forget the look
on her face as she ceases to exist...
Late at night, when you think about
her, will Stravanavitch really matter
anymore?
Marshall tries to look away, but Zedeck forces him to watch.
ALICE
Daddy. Daddy, please...
ROSE
Jim... for godsake!
KORSHUNOV
Look inside your heart. No one will
think you weak. Five...
Alice's face, trying to be brave.
KORSHUNOV
Four...
ROSE
Jim...
KORSHUNOV
Three...
Rose looks away.
KORSHUNOV
Two. .
Alice looks at her father for the very last time. Then shuts
her eyes tight.
KORSHUNOV
One...
Gibbs begins to squeeze the trigger.
MARSHALL
NO!
Korshunov smiles.
MARSHALL
Stop.
KORSHUNOV
You'll do it?
MARSHALL
Yes, I'll do it.
(broken)
Just leave my family alone.
KORSHUNOV
Good. Good.
Gibbs withdraws the gun from Alice's temple. Alice opens her
eyes and gasps for breath.
KORSHUNOV
Bring him the phone...
You are true to your nature, Mr.
President.
MARSHALL
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
KORSHUNOV
You don't like seeing people get
hurt. Now in morality, that is a
virtue. In politics, however, that
is weakness.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
A sleepless Petrov paces back and forth, smoking a cigarette.
The phone RINGS. He looks up expectantly as his aide answers.
AIDE
Sir, the President of the United
States wishes to speak with you.
Petrov stops in mid-pace. Considers his cigarette for a moment
and then walks over to the phone.
PETROV
Mr. President.
INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT
A guard walks down the cold steel hallway. He rattles the
bar of a darkened cage, he pulls out a set of keys and unlocks
the door.
GUARD
Stravanavitch.
Stravanavitch awakes, and leans forward into the light. He
and the guard trade looks. After a beat, the guard turns and
retreats down the the hallway.
Stravanavitch rises from his bunk and approaches the cell
door. He leans against it and it swings open.
INT. M.C.C. - NIGHT
Rose stares at Marshall. Her look is hard to read. Distant...
cold, perhaps.
ROSE
Can my husband sit next to me?
Korshunov considers the pair. Hands taped behind their back.
They're harmless. Korshunov nods.
Marshall rises and joins her on the pilot's rest bunk.
ROSE
I don't know why you stayed.
MARSHALL
Please... don't start with me.
Rose moves closer to him, and speaks in a low voice.
ROSE
There's something I need to tell
you... and God knows if I'll ever
get another chance.
From behind, we see her push his taped hands away.
He looks at her quizically.
ROSE
No matter what happens, you have
been and always will be my hero.
He feels the wall behind him. A dull edge of metal twisted
slightly from the earlier cockpit door explosion.
He understands.
MARSHALL
And you have always been my guardian
angel.
She smiles back at him.
ROSE
I will never regret my life with
you.
Behind Marshall's back, he begins to cut away at the duct
tape.
INT. MOSCOW CENTRAL PRISON, HALLWAY - NIGHT
Ivan Stravanavitch walks down the long prison hallway. Other
PRISONERS see him and begin banging on their bars in rhythm.
As he parades down the corridor, the banging grows until it
becomes deafening. Stravanavitch smiles a cocky smile.
One by one, guard doors swing open in front of him. In fact,
a few of the HACKS salute Stravanavitch as he passes.
INT. MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - AIR FORCE ONE
The communication board beeps and Zedeck picks up the line.
He exchanges some words with the caller in Russian, then
hangs up the phone.
SERGE
It's confirmed. Stravanavitch is on
his way out. Our men are waiting
outside.
Korshunov smiles and puts his hand on Zedeck's shoulder.
ROSE
You got what you wanted. You going
to release us now?
KORSHUNOV
You're very valuable. And our nation
needs so many things.
Marshall leans his head against the wall. Just as he expected.
MARSHALL
Could I... Could I have some water?
Korshunov nods, motions Zedeck to take care of it. Zedeck
reluctanty descends to the main cabin.
KORSHUNOV
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
MARSHALL
One thing I've learned as
President... all defeats are temporary and all victories are
temporary. Today' 5 conquerers are tomorrow's vanquished.
KORSHUNOV
e Very poetic.
Zedeck arrives with a glass of water.
MARSHALL
And there's one thing I've learned
from being a sports fan.
Zedeck brings the cup of water to Marshall's lips. Marshall
tips his head back to receive it.
KORSHUNOV
And that is?
Water spills over Marshall's face. He shakes it off.
MARSHALL
It ain't over, til it's over.
With blinding speed, Marshall leaps to his feet and swings
his arm around Zedeck's throat. He snaps Zedeck's neck with
quiet efficency.
Gibbs fires at Marshall, but Marshall, using Zedeck as a
shield, grabs hold of the terrorist'sMP5 and lets loose...
mowing down the former Secret Service agent.
The rest of Gibb's shots pelt against the cockpit controls
sending showers of sparks flying.
Korshunov whips out his gun and lines up a clean shot at
Marshall's head.
MAJOR CALDWELL
Mr. President.
Korshunov fires at Marshall, but...
Major Caidwell dives in front of the bullet spray taking the
rounds in his chest.
Marshall turns his aim to Korshunov... but Korshunov grabs
Alice and presses his pistol to her head.
Stand-off.
KORSHUNOV
Don't be hasty.
Marshall holds Korshunov in his sights. Slowly advancing.
KORSHUNOV
You love your daughter, Mr.
President. And I love my country.
It's a fair trade.
Korshunov backs away to the steps. Marshall does not lower
his gun. Korshunov disappears down the staircase.
MARSHALL
Shepherd.
SHEPHERD
Sir...
Shepherd stands. Marshall unwraps Shepherd's hands.
MARSHALL
Call Petrov...
(to Rose)
I'll be back.
ROSE
Both of you.
Marshall slowly descends the steps to the main cabin. As
soon as Shepherd gets her hands loose, Rose rushes to
Caidwell's aid. Shepherd crosses to the communications panel
and picks up a headset. Begins dialing numbers
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
In his nightdress, Stoli Petrov nurses a vodka on ice. His
PHONE RINGS.
PETROV

Petrov's eyes widen.
EXT. MOSCOW PRISON EXERCISE YARD - NIGHT
A wall of bars part and Stravanavitch walks through. Into
the main exercise yard.
The main gate separates him from...
A group of men wait in the street by a limousine.
The main gate opens slowly.
When the men sees Stravanavitch they come to attention and
salute him. Stravanavitch returns the salute. And then starts
his march toward his limousine...
A SIREN WAILS. LIGHTS FLOOD THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE
PRISON.
The front gate begins to close. Worry crosses Stravanavitch's
face. His men rush toward him, take position by the gate.
Stravanavitch breaks into a run toward his limousine.
GUARD
Halt! Halt!
Stravanvitch looks behind him. Guards rushing toward him
from the yard... the limousine fifty yards ahead of him...
closing fast...
On the limo... the back door open and waiting.
A shot rings out from the guard tower, followed by another,
and another. Like popcorn starting to pop. Stravanavitch's
men return fire. A minor war breaks out. Loyal guards battling
Stravanavitch sympathizers.
Stravanavitch caught in the middle, hit by one bullet, then
another, then another. He makesit to the open rear door of
the limousine, but collapses dead.
Everyone stops firing. Stravanavitch's men rush to his side..
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Petrov slips under the covers as an aide knocks on his door.
PETROV
What is it?
AIDE
It's about Stravanvaitch.
PETROV
What about him?
AIDE
He's dead, sir. Shot while trying to
escape.
A beat.
PETROV
So be it. The world will sleep easier.
Petrov turns out his bedside light.

ROSE

Caidwell smiles, settles peacefully back in the cot. He dies.
Rose reaches up and shuts his eyes.
INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT
Marshall makes his way through the dimness. Stepping
cautiously.
A shot rings out and richochets off a piece of piping right
over Marshall's head.
Undaunted Marshall advances.
MARSHALL
It's over, Korshunov. You won. Now
let her go.
He listens, footsteps ahead of him.
ON Korshunov - holding Alice by her hair, practically dragging
her over the mid-section wing cross-braces.
As Marshall appears in the gangway he fires off another shot,
hitting a cooling vent. Steam fills the' gangway area, bathed
in red auxiliary lighting.
Korshunov retreats toward the rear of the plane.
MARSHALL (O.S.)
There's nowhere to go.

GENERAL NORTHiqOOD Fifteen miles, so two minutes.
LEE
The Iraqi Ambassador won't take our

V.P. CHANDLER
If challenged, our fighters are to
state that they are on a rescue

Marshall checks behind the racks of stored goods and luggage.

A finger on the trigger.
ALICE

Korshunov fires and Marshall dives out of the way. He cones
up in defensive crouch ready to shoot, but all he can see is
Alice.
MARSHALL
How you doing, sweetie?
ALICE
Been better, Dad... You?
Marshall smiles briefly. But Alice is yanked around the
corner. Marshall hears foatsteps. He junps to his feet and
cautiously follows.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE, LOWER AFT GALLEY - NIGHT
Marshall swings into the cubicle... empty.
He crosses to the cargo bay/parachute launch ramp hatchway.
Looks through the porthole.
Korshunov straps on one of the few remaining parachutes. He
tosses the rest of the spares out onto the platform.
Marshall steps onto the platform. Korshunov fires off a round
forcing him behind the door for cover.
Korshunov pulls Alice in front of him and yanks down the
ramp activation lever.
KORSHUNOV
Stay where you are.
The ramp lowers, and Alice gets her first look at the drop.
Marshall watches the remaining parachutes slide off the ramp
and into the stormy sky.
KORSHUNOV
There goes your ride.
MARSHALL
Let my daughter go or I'll take you
out!
KORSHUNOV
If you put down the gun, I promise
not to drop her on the way down.
Korshunov backs toward the edge of the ramp, pulling a
struggling and fighting Alice.
MARSHALL
Let her go now! Or I will kill you.
Korshunov is a foot away from the edge of the ramp... two
steps back, he and Alice will take the plunge.
Marshall lines up his shot. Korshunov laughs as he presses
his pistol to Alice's ear.
KORSHUNOV
No you won't. You'll compromise...
like always.
MARSHALL
Hold on, Alice.
Marshall fires, his bullet ripping apart a good deal of
Korshunov's face and snapping his body back.
Korshunov tumbles off the platform, but his limbs are caught.
in Alice's. She's knocked to her belly and his dead weight
drags her off the edge of the platform.
ALICE
NO!
Marshall dives down the sloping platform, reaching out for
her...
Alice tries to grip the platform with her hands, but she
can't hold on. Her hand slip off the metallic lip.
But as she falls, she's caught by the wrist. Strong arms
pull her up. Her father's arms. He carries her back to the
safety of the plane. She's sobs uncontrollably.
ALICE
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
MARSHALL
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got
you. You're okay.
Shepherd and Rose appear. Marshall locks eyes with Rose...
smiles. Shepherd crosses to the parachute bins.

GENERAL CERALLOS eyes the radar.
IRAQI SOLDIER
The Americans say they are escorting
a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm
they are surrounding a 747.
CERALLOS
Did we warn them off?
IRAQI SOLDIER
Yes. They refused to alter course
and the 747 would not answer our
hails.
Cerallos takes a moment, looking at the screen.
CERALLOS
It's some kind of trick... a
preliminary airstrike in response to
our troop movement.
IRAQI SOLDIER
They are in our airspace. We would
be within our rights.
CERALLOS
The world would not look on us kindly
if we shot down a civilian airliner.
The Soldier listens to chatter coning over his headset.
IRAQI SOLDIER
The pilot says it is does not have
the markings of a commercial jet.
CERALLOS
Warn then again. If they don't
respond... shoot them down. We will
not be intimidated.
EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
INT. MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT
Another sonic boom.
MARSHALL
What is that sound?
Marshall makes his way to the cockpit.
Through the cockpit window, a MiG accelerates out of the
darkness coming straight at us. At the last second it pulls
up slightly, riding over the top of the 747.
Its sonic boom rocks the jumbo jet.
MARSHALL
My god. I think that was a MiG.
SHEPHERD
A MiG? Where the hell are we?
Marshall rushes back to one of the rear upper deck windows.
He looks out at the F-l5s.
MARSHALL
They're flying a protection formation.

over Carlton's rolling wings.
COL. CARLTON

Halo Team is cleared to engage. I repeat, you are cleared to
engage.
Carlton pulls his plane into a monster climb.
COL. CARLTON
This is the real thing boys. Let's
fly and fry.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT
A ringing phone is answered by an aide. A few beats.

Iraq.
INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
Marshall settles into the pilot's chair. Shepherd comes in.
SHEPHERD
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
MARSHALL
Iraq? Shep, you're fired.

sir?
MARSHALL
Twenty-five years.

Finger on the trigger.
MIG PILOT
It's evading. Can I take the shot?
MIG LEADER (V.0.)
Take the shot.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
Looking forward from underneath an F-15, the MiG heads toward
Air Force One. The F-15 fires a sidewinder.
On the MIG... as it fires its missile. The F-15's sidewinder
blows the MIG up, taking the missile with it.
Air Force One is clear... for the time being.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE, COCKPIT - NIGHT
MARSHALL STRUGGLES TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE 747. HE OVER-
compensates and the plane rocks side-to-side.
ROSE
What are you doing?
MARSHALL
Flying the plane.
ROSE
You haven't even driven a car since
you took office.
Marshall checks out the tactical display.
MARSHALL
I'm sure it's like riding a bicycle...
downhill with no brakes and somebody
shooting at you.
Marshall finds the throttle, pushes it up all the way. He
feels the plane out, gently nudges it into a turn.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
Two MiGs flare out of an engagement with the F-15's and break
toward Air Force One.
COL. CARLTON
We got two on the loose. Someone get

at the President's plane, before breaking in opposite
directions.

harmlessly to earth.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE COCKPIT - NIGHT
The shock waves from a nearby MiG explosion shakes the plane.
In the aftermath, Marshall takes a moment and pulls on the
pilot's headset.
MARSHALL
U.S. Pilots, this is Air Force One.

party.
FIGHTER PILOT #1 (V.0.)
I'm on it.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT
On the two MiG's heading for Air Force One.
An F-15 drops in behind them. The MiGs scissor and break in
OPPosite directions. The F-l5 can only follow one of them.
FIGHTER PILOT 11
I'm tight on one, the other's loose.
I need help down here.
The other MiG comes up on the 747 and opens fire with his
CANNONS. The shells rip up the surface of the aircraft's
wing. The MiG swoops past Air Force One and jerks into a *
vertical.
On the damaged wing - Fuel starts leaking out and the outer
jet engine catches fire.
INT. COCKPIT, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Red warning light flashes on the control panel.
MARSHALL
We're hit. We've got an engine on
fire.
COT. CAALTON (V.0.)

EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
The engine whirs to a halt and the rushing wind blows out
the fire. But now she's only got three engines.
INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT
Through the cockpit window, an F-15 settles in front of Air
Force One... Flames pouring out of its tail. Under any other
condition, it would be pretty. Alice, Rose and Shepherd watch
Marshall fly.
MARSHALL
This is President Marshall. I know
you guys are busy, but we need some
help here.
INT. CARLTON'S F-15 COCKPIT - NIGHT
Canton in pursuit of a Mis.
COL. CARLTON
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now
with your permission can we lead you
the fuck out of here.
MARSHALL
You read my mind.
COL. CARLTON
Put your pilot on.
MARSHALL
He's busy being dead.
Carlton breaks left, lines up a MiG and fires. He nails the
Iraqi aircraft.
COL. CARLTON
Who's flying the fucking plane?
MARSHALL
I'm doing what I can.
COL. CAELTON
Can you, can you change your heading
to Zero Four One point six?
MARSHALL
Negative. We've lost navagition. I
don't know where that is.
Buzzer sounds in Carlton's cockpit. He's been locked on.
COL. CARLTON
Oh shit. Hang on. Somebody help me
out. I got one up my ass.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
Carlton puts his plane into a triple canopy roll then slams
on his airbreaks. The MiS shoots by him and Carlton lets
loose with his CANNONS. The MiG pulls up and disengages.
COL. CARLTON
Two and three are heading toward the
Boeing.
COL. CARLTON
Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to
the right. Got it?
MARSHALL
Got it.
COL. CARLTON
Stay cool.
Canton's plane edges around to the right... and Marshall
follows. The 747 leans at an angle and continues the turn
until the F-15 is dead ahead. Another plane explodes ahead
of him at three o'clock.
MARSHALL
How we doing, Colonel?
COL. CARLTON
We still got three MiGs running around
and six more on the way.
Can't you fly any faster?
IRA'. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

The missile has Air Force One dead to rights, crawling right
up its tail pipe.
Just before its about to hit the plane...
FIGHTER PILOT 11
YAAAAAAAAH!
An F-15 swoops up from below. Like a Secret Service agent
during an assassination attempt...
The F-15 takes the bullet in its mid-section. BOOM!
The blast slams bits of the fighter plane against Air Force
One. Rocking it badly. Chunks of the plane rip away metal
sheeting on the 747's wings and tail section.
INT. F-15 COCKPIT - NIGHT
COL. CARLTON
We got six more bogeys, closing fast
from the south.
EXT. SKY - NIGHT

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

COL. CARLTON
I'm sorry, sir.
Carlton salutes Marshall. Marshall returns it.
MARSHALL
Thanks for your help, Colonel.
INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT

V.P. CHANDLER
The Chief Justice? What on earth
for?
GENERAL NORTHWOOD
To swear you in as President.
Dead silence in the room.

The Ranger returns fire, shooting round after round at Gibbs

FADE IN:
EXT. MOJAVE DESERT - DAY (TELEVISION IMAGE)
A LONG LENS SHOT of a far distant metallic object hovering
just above the ground -- maybe two or three miles away.
The heat waves and the light refraction off the desert-
scape make the object undulate rhythmically, keeping its
true shape and appearance indistinct.
The VIDEO CAMERA recording this scene zooms back, then
pans over -- revealing a semicircle of US Army vehicles
and personnel. Army Engineers with their tripod-mounted
scopes and binoculars are shoulder to shoulder with the
armed infantry. Everyone stares off at the same point on
the horizon. Waiting.
The VIDEO CAMERA movements are HANDHELD, unsteady, as it
moves through the line of Army personnel to reveal a
second, less organized semicircle of observers fifty yards
behind the Army. LOCALS from nearby towns perch in truck
beds and on car roofs, Budweiser and Fritos at hand, eyes
glued to the distant object.
The VIDEO CAMERA image climbs up onto the roof of a parked
local TV van, finds the object again in the distance,
zooms in, and waits, like everyone else.
Abruptly the VIDEO IMAGE contracts, becoming a box
CHROMAKEYED behind CNN reporter DUNCAN CRAIS.
CRAIS
That was the scene in California's
Mojave Desert three years ago today
-- the historic first view of the
Newcomer ship upon its dramatic
arrival. As with the assassination
of John Kennedy, who among us does
not remember exactly where he was
that October nineteenth morning,
when news first broke: that people
have landed... from another star.
We PULL BACK from a large television set to reveal...
INT. A CROWDED BAR - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT
The Hollowpoint Lounge -- a cop bar.
The off-duty uniformed and plainclothes cops are mostly
ignoring the TV, except for two detectives, FEDORCHUK and
ALTEREZ, who are waiting for the ball scores.
FEDORCHUK
I remember where I was -- pissing
off my balcony at the neighbor's
dog!
Others laugh.
ALTEREZ
(yells at Crais on TV)
Get to the goddamn ball scores!
ON THE TV SCREEN, an on-location interview with a CAL-TECH
PROFESSOR comes up. Her name and title appear across the
bottom of the screen.
CAL-TECH PROFESSOR
From the time mankind first gazed up
at the stars there had been
speculation about a visit by people
from ""out there."" How ironic that
when that first contact was made,
the two hundred and sixty thousand
occupants aboard the craft were as
surprised as we were about their
arrival. That they awakened from
frozen hibernation to find their
malfunctioning autopilot had landed
them here by mistake.
The CNN reporter, Duncan Crais, appears again.
CRAIS
These ""Newcomers,"" we soon learned,
were a genetically-engineered race,
adapted for hard labor in almost any
environmental condition. In effect,
their ship was a slave ship...
washed ashore on Earth with no way
to get back to where they came
from...
A dishwasher tray filled with beer glasses CUTS ACROSS
FRAME, and we PAN WITH IT as it is slammed down on the
countertop.
Now an interview with a FRESNO HOUSEWIFE standing outside
a supermarket comes on the TV SCREEN.
FRESNO HOUSEWIFE
When the Newcomers were first let
out of the ship, they were
quarantined in a camp not ten miles
from the town here. You can imagine
how the people around here felt
about that. But once they were
releases from the camp and we got a
chance to know them, we saw what
nice, quiet people they really are...
WIDER
revealing a MASSIVE ALIEN FIGURE in a filthy white
busboy's uniform. His back is to us as he picks up two
trays from the counter. The bartender is dwarfed by this
Newcomer, but works around him without apparent concern.
Fedorchuk addresses the alien busboy.
FEDORCHUK
Hey, Henry, how you doin' tonight?
Workin' hard?
The Newcomer turns -- his face is humanoid, but
disturbingly alien.
FEDORCHUK
You got your green card, buddy? You
didn't leave home without it?
The cops at the bar crack up. Henry looks at Fedorchuk --
his eyes carrying no malice... or pain. He merely blinks.
CUT TO:
INT./ EXT. SLUG-MOBILE - STREET - NIGHT
An explosion of color and movement as OPENING TITLES PLAY
very quickly. We're TRAVELING the streets in a n.d.
sedan, getting MOVING GLIMPSES of the aliens living among
us now:
-- A coffee shop where aliens eat at some window tables.
-- A Newcomer leaving a night school with an armload of
books.
-- A city park where a number of alien families have
gathered to play some arcane alien game.
SYKES
Jeez... they call that gang-bang a
game...?
-- A billboard for Pepsi featuring an alien.
-- The sedan has pulled to a stop at a red light.
Suddenly a hand thumps against the glass next to Sykes'
head... and alien hand. Sykes jumps. It's a NEWCOMER
DERELICT standing there, weaving, mumbling in his own
language. In one filthy hand holds a quart carton of
milk. We know immediately what he wants. Sykes rolls
down the window.
SYKES
Take a hike.
Sykes gets a whiff of the derelict's breath as the light
changes and the sedan pulls away, leaving him in the
street. Sykes grimaces at the smell.
SYKES
Why's it have to be sour milk that
these guys get wasted on? What the
hell's wrong with Jack Daniels, or
Thunderbird for chrissakes?
(beat; disgusted)
Slagtown. Shit...
-- Aliens hanging around outside their homes.
-- Alien hookers plying their trade.
SYKES
Hope their plumbing's the same.
TUGGLE
It is.
(and Sykes gives him
a look)
-- A Newcomer lowrider pulls up beside the slug-mobile.
-- An alien couple exit a theater playing ""Terminator
III"".
-- An alien wig shop.
ANGLE
TITLES END, and we start to PULL BACK into the slug-mobile
and HEAR:
TUGGLE (O.S.)
So you gonna go, or you not gonna
go?
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
The dashboard is littered with fast-food detritus and two
coffees in styrofoam cups making fog circles on the
windshield. A hand picks up one of the coffees and we
FOLLOW IT to a face, a forty-year-old cop face that's seen
some wear and tear -- behind the wheel is MATT SYKES.
Beside him is his partner of nine years, BILL TUGGLE.
Tuggle expertly munches on a slice of pizza as he talks.
SYKES
How can I go?
TUGGLE
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and
your clip-on tie, have your landlady
tie your shoes for you, and show up
at the church. Simple.
(beat)
Me and Carol are going.
SYKES
What?
TUGGLE
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin
since... since she was conceived in
that cabin up in Big Bear.
Remember? You and Edie banged the
wall so hard, me and Carol were
picking plaster out of our hair for
a week...
SYKES
Goddammit, Tug -- I want to see
Kristin get married, okay? But--
TUGGLE
But you're bummed because your ex
and her new husband are paying for
the whole thing.
SYKES
Shit, if Kristin had to get married
where I could afford it, we'd be
holding the reception at Buddy's
Burgers.
Sykes stares out the window, wallowing in his pissed-off
mood. Then he spots something that twinges his street-cop
radar.
SYKES
Uh-oh... Check it out.
THROUGH THE WINDOW Tuggle sees what Sykes sees: two ALIENS
in long coats moving down the sidewalk, entering a mom-
and-pop mini-mart on the corner. One of them wears dark
glasses and a red bandana (KIPLING): the other has on a
black vinyl raincoat.
SYKES
Does that look at all suspicious to
you?
TUGGLE
Whatever gave you that idea?
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Sykes continues up a quarter of a block, pulls to the curb
among other parked cars.
INT. SEDAN - NIGHT
Sykes is already pulling his gun. Tuggle quickly reaches
for the radio in the glovebox.
TUGGLE
This is one-Henry-seven, we've got a
possible two-eleven in progress at
Porter's Mini-Mart, corner of Court
and Alvarado. Requesting backup.
Impulsive Sykes is already opening his door and climbing
out.
SYKES
Let's do it, partner.
Tuggle drops the radio mike and follows Sykes as the Radio
Dispatcher confirms the call.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
The two cops, guns in hand, move along the row of parked
cars across the street from the mini-mart. Through the
store window they see the old alien PROPRIETOR behind the
counter. His eyes go wide as Kipling whips back his coat
and yanks out a short combat pump-shotgun and aims it
right at him. The Raincoat alien pulls an identical gun
and covers the door.
Sykes and Tuggle react to the firepower inside.
SYKES
You got your vest?
TUGGLE
Of course. Right in the trunk of
the car.
SYKES
Yeah, that's comforting. Mine, too.
Through the store window the robbery continues in
pantomime. Kipling gestures viciously with the shotgun,
yelling orders in the alien language. The Proprietor is
quickly filling a paper bag with cash from the register.
The PROPRIETOR'S WIFE, a middle-aged alien woman, stands
in the doorway from the back, frozen in fear. The
Raincoat alien dances from foot to foot, antsy, wired.
Sykes and Tuggle crouch at the car directly across the
street from the store entrance.
TUGGLE
Watch the driver. I'm going for a
better angle on the door.
SYKES
I got him. Don't get pinned.
Tuggle leaves the cover provided by the car, runs cater-
corner across the intersection.
Through the store window Sykes sees Kipling grab the bag
of cash, shove it in his coat pocket. Bills fall out, but
he doesn't care. Then, without warning, Kipling whips up
the twelve gauge and blows a hole in the Proprietor's
chest! The Proprietor slams back against the shelves,
slides to the floor. Kipling leans over the counter and
FIRES another round into the Proprietor.
SYKES
(under his breath)
Aw, shit.
Tuggle is almost across the street when he hears the
shots.
The human DRIVER of the getaway car (parked at the curb a
few doors down from the mini-mart) glances up, spots
Tuggle. He leans on the HORN, reaches for a machine
pistol on the seat next to him.
INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
Kipling and Raincoat alien react to the horn honk. They
spot Tuggle through the store window and open fire --
BLASTING THROUGH THE GLASS.
A civilian car enters the intersection. The engine is hit
by shotgun fire, and the car skids to a stop in the
intersection, steam rising from the radiator.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Tuggle dives behind a lamp post.
The Driver is out of the car now, brings up the machine
pistol to fire at Tuggle. Sykes sees this and opens fire
at the Driver. The Driver turns and fires at Sykes.
Sykes ducks down, and the car he's hiding behind is
sprayed with bullets.
A forty-foot moving van pulls down the street between
Sykes and the Driver. Once the truck is past, Sykes is
standing behind the bullet-riddled car, gun ready. He
rapid-fires -- creaming the human Driver.
Tuggle is pinned down behind the thin lamp post by the
shotgun fire from Kipling and Raincoat alien.
SYKES
Get outta there!
TUGGLE
I can't! Do you mind!
SYKES
I'll cover you! Get outta there!!
Sykes rises and runs across the street toward the getaway
car, firing toward the store as he goes.
Kipling and Raincoat dodge behind cover.
Tuggle seizes the opportunity, jumps from behind the lamp
post and runs to the stalled civilian car. He slides
across the hood and drops behind the car for cover.
Tuggle slowly pokes his head up to peer through the car
window. His gaze is met by the face of the OLD MAN driver
who is still inside the car.
OLD MAN
Can I get out now?
TUGGLE
Move it!
Sykes doesn't have a clear firing line on the aliens in
the store. As he considers his next move--
Tuggle fires at the two aliens. They return fire and he
slides down to safety behind the car. Or so he thinks.
Glass rains down on him as the car windows are cremated by
the shotgun blasts. He flinches as another blast hits the
car. He looks over. There's a big exit hole in the
fender beside him. THE SHOT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE CAR.
Another exit hole is BLASTED, inches from his shoulder.
Panicked, he scrambles along the side of the car -- BLASTS
and exit holes following him until he reaches the front of
the car. He has nowhere left to go and--
-- a BLAST comes through the car and catches him squarely
in the chest throwing him back onto the street.
Sykes' head jerks around -- in time to see his partner of
nine years blown away.
Kipling keeps firing in Tuggle's direction until his
shotgun CLICKS empty.
INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
Kipling grabs Raincoat and throws him toward the back exit
of the store. The shotgun falls from Raincoat's hands.
The two of them run out the back.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Sykes runs to Tuggle's spread-eagled body. One glance is
enough. Nobody ever looked deader.
SYKES
Aw shit, Tug, Jesus! Goddamn it!
He stares, shocked and incredulous. He can't find a way
to think or feel about this. Then we see him going crazy
right before our eyes, the rage revving. He takes off
toward the store as SIRENS are HEARD rapidly approaching
in background.
INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
Sykes moves through like a locomotive skidding on broken
glass, bangs through the exit.
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
Sykes catches sight of the two aliens just as they round
the corner at the far end of the alley. He takes off,
quickly cranking up to full speed.
EXT. BACK STREET - NIGHT
Sykes rounds the corner. Doesn't see them anymore. He
slows... moves along this street with some caution. Lots
of shadows, lots of hiding places. Sykes HEARS a NOISE,
looks up... just in time to see Raincoat on a high, huge
billboard. He cuts loose with the shotgun. Sykes dives.
Huge chunks of the crate he dives behind fly off into the
night. Sykes, on his belly, scrambles deeper among the
crates.
Raincoat's shotgun CLICKS empty now. He drops it, swings
down off the fire escape, runs off.
Sykes is up again in a flash, pounding after him.
EXT. TUNNEL STREET - NIGHT
Sykes rounds this second corner, races down the street.
The only route they could've taken is through a tunnel up
ahead. Sykes approaches the tunnel, all senses wide open.
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
The murkiness of the tunnel engulfs him as he moves
through the mouth. He tries to control his breathing so
he can hear. The only SOUND is his own shoes scuffing
along the asphalt.
Then he HEARS -- another set of FOOTSTEPS. Rapid
footsteps, coming toward him, ECHOING. He can't tell from
which direction! He spins, just as a LARGE SHAPE lunges
for him with an alien CRY.
It's the wired Raincoat alien. Sykes gets his gun up just
in time and FIRES -- once, twice, three times. Raincoat
alien is knocked backwards to the wet asphalt by the
blasts. Sykes approaches the body slowly. With an
inhuman ROAR, the alien snaps forward, lunging at Sykes
with outstretched arms. Sykes jumps back, startled, and
FIRES twice more at the pale figure. Raincoat goes down
and stays down.
Sykes relaxes for the briefest moment. Then he HEARS
it... a distinctive CLICKING SOUND, metal on metal. Sykes
looks up and -- Kipling drops down on him from directly
above! Sykes goes down in a heap. He's managed to hold
onto the gun and as Kipling comes for him, he swings the
gun hand around. Kipling sees it, lashes out, slamming
the gun from Sykes' hand. Sykes tries to get to his feet,
but the alien grabs him and flings him down the tunnel.
A SIREN is HEARD approaching in background.
Kipling moves in to deliver the coup de grace. As he
draws near, Sykes HEARS that distinctive CLICKING SOUND
again.
SYKES' P.O.V.
Though his vision is BLURRED, Sykes still gets a good look
at an exotic silver bracelet on the alien's wrist. The
strands of this bracelet are what make the CLINKING NOISE.
ANGLE
The alien rears back, and as he does, the approaching
SIREN suddenly WAILS louder as a backup patrol car swings
onto the street heading this way. Kipling sees this and
leaves Sykes, running off down the dark tunnel.
ON SYKES
dazed, struggling to rise. WE HEAR running FOOTSTEPS
approaching. Sykes turns, his eyes wild and unfocused.
SYKES' P.O.V.
An OUT-OF-FOCUS ALIEN FACE looming over him.
ANGLE
Sykes whips around in a roundhouse swing with all his
weight on it, pistoning his fist straight into the alien
face. The alien, caught by surprise and off balance,
sprawls backward OUT OF FRAME. Sykes is grabbed by a
human uniformed cop, as he tries to swing again.
HUMAN COP
Whoa, whoa... hold it. Take it easy.
(to alien on the
ground)
You okay?
Sykes stops struggling, and his eyes focus. He looks at
the alien he just decked, sprawled on his ass ten feet
away. The alien is a uniformed cop... his name is JETSON.
JETSON
I am all right.
He gets up. A trickle of purple blood runs from his nose.
HUMAN COP
I better call in.
He moves off. Jetson moves toward Sykes and the Raincoat
alien's body. Sykes tenses, thinking Jetson might
retaliate in some way. But Jetson simply steps past him
to kneel beside the dead alien. He checks for a pulse on
the underside of the dead alien's upper arm. Nothing.
Sykes is holding his punching hand in obvious pain. He
struggles to rise. Jetson gets an arm around him to help
him up.
JETSON
Your hand will require attention.
Sykes roughly jerks himself free of Jetson's grip.
SYKES
Get the hell away from me! I don't
need your goddamn help.
He almost loses his balance and has to steady himself
against the tunnel wall. Sykes leans there, the picture
of impotent rage and frustration. Jetson looks at him,
with that slight inquisitive expression aliens exhibit
when trying to understand human nature.
EXT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
OPEN on Tuggle's body, as the body bag is zipped up over
his face, and the litter is lifted into the back of the
Coroner's wagon.
WIDEN to reveal Sykes, standing nearby, watching. The
Wagon pulls out, and Sykes turns, moving past all the LAPD
black-and-whites and forensics wagons, and COPS (two of
them aliens) and DETECTIVES, and RUBBERNECKERS (some
alien). He moves into:
INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
The CRIME SCENE TEAM is checking for prints, digging slugs
out of the wall, photographing everything. Several
UNIFORMED COPS mill around. Sykes moves aimlessly around
the room like a stranger at a party.
The Proprietor's Wife stands near the body in a strange
rigid posture, a thin, mournful KEENING SOUND coming from
her lips. A harried female uniformed cop is trying to get
her away from the body, but can't get her to budge.
MINKLER, a ballistics guy, is tagging the pump-shotgun the
Raincoat alien dropped here. NATUZZI, a mean-looking
veteran uniform cop is with him.
NATUZZI
Looks like a standard combat pump-
action.
MINKLER
It is.
NATUZZI
So what punched holes clear through
that car out there?
Minkler pulls an evidence baggie from his work box.
Inside are four unfired twelve gauge shells.
MINKLER
BRI Sabot slugs. These puppies are
nasty. Two plastic sabots fall away
in flight leaving a fifty-caliber
slug going two thousand feet per
second. Tug might as well've been
hiding behind a rosebush.
Minkler senses somebody has just stepped up beside him.
He looks. It's Sykes.
NATUZZI
Pretty heavy artillery for knocking
over a liquor store.
A new voice enters the conversation.
JETSON (O.S.)
An identical round was used in the
shooting of a Newcomer named
Hubley, two days ago.
Sykes turns -- surprised, and not especially pleased to
see the voice is Jetson's.
MINKLER
Yeah? So why the extra fire power?
JETSON
Perhaps because even the larger
caliber handguns aren't always
effective against my people.
SYKES
(mulls this, then)
You saying there's some connection
to this other homicide?
Before Jetson can say, the female cop who was talking to
the Proprietor's Wife steps up.
FEMALE COP
Hey, give me a hand with this woman,
will ya Jetson? We've got to get
her to Division for her statement
and she won't budge.
JETSON
(to Sykes)
Excuse me.
And he moves off with his partner. Sykes calls after him,
but Jetson is already approaching the woman and doesn't
turn.
SYKES
So, you think there's a connection,
or what? Hey!
CUT TO:
EXT. SYKES' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
The slug-mobile pulls up. A drained Sykes moves up the
walk to his front door.
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Sykes enters his apartment, an untidy bachelor place
decorated with negative taste. It's obviously the maid's
decade off.
By rote, he hits the rewind switch on the answering
machine on his way into the kitchen. The tape rewinds.
He opens the fridge. Not much here. Left-over take-out
pizza carton. Left-over take-out Chinese food cartons.
Left-over take-out burger wrappers.
The answering machine message begins -- he glances over
his shoulder as he HEARS his daughter's VOICE. During the
following, he reaches the fridge. Brings out a milk
carton that's in his way, sets it on the counter. Reaches
in again and this time brings out a bottle of Stoly. Then
searches for a semi-clean glass.
KRISTIN'S VOICE
(bouncy, bride-to-be
happy)
Hi, Daddy, it's me. I'm over at
Danny's parents' house... talking
about Sunday. I thought maybe you'd
be home by now. Anyway, uh, nothing
really. I just wanted to call and
say I love you. I love you, Daddy.
(she giggles)
Uh-oh, I shouldn't'a done that.
Knowing you, you'll probably pull
this tape out of your machine and
save it -- in that drawer where you
keep every card I ever gave you, and
all of my old baby teeth... gross!
Anyway, Daddy, don't save this tape
-- but I do love you, and I'll talk
to you before Sunday.
(beat)
Oh, Tug and Carol came by and met
Danny last week.
(Sykes stiffens)
Danny thought Tug was the greatest
-- but, then, who doesn't? Anyway,
love you, talk to you soon. 'Bye.
The machine BEEPS and HISSES. Sykes take the glass and
the bottle of vodka, crosses back toward the living room,
switching off the answering machine as he goes.
Then he stops, turns back, takes the message tape out of
the machine and tosses it into a drawer.
FADE TO:
INT. DETECTIVE SQUAD ROOM - DAY
Sykes enters, stirring a jumbo coffee. He's slept about
four hours, and his face looks like he went a few with
Hagler. He crosses straight to Fedorchuk's desk.
SYKES
So what've you got on Tuggle's
killers?
FEDORCHUK
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than
ten hours. Me and Alterez are on
it, okay?
SYKES
You don't have squat.
FEDORCHUK
You ever try to make a case in
Slagtown? The list of Newcomer
informants is about as long as the
list of Mexican war heroes...
ALTEREZ
Up yours.
FEDORCHUK
... Nobody talks to nobody down
there. Half of them don't speak
English and the other half only when
it suits them. It's gonna take some
time.
SYKES
Yeah, I know it's gonna take time.
Like until the Ice Capades opens in
Hell, with you two on it.
Across the room, the Captain's door BANGS open and CAPTAIN
WARNER pounds out, his deep voice booming through the
squad room.
WARNER
Nobody wanders off! I got an
announcement. Get your asses back
in here.
Two detectives on their way out, stop, and head back into
the room. Everybody gathers around, curious, as Warner
stands holding a sheet of paper.
WARNER
I'll make this short. This is a
directive from Chief Evaner, who is
acting on orders from the Mayor, who
is under mandate from the Federal
Bureau of Newcomer Relations. As of
nine o'clock this morning, one
Newcomer uniform officer has been
promoted to the rank of Detective,
third grade.
The detectives GROAN... some angrier ones grumble, ""This
is bullshit!"", etc.
WARNER
And we've got him, gentleman.
(more groans)
Volunteers for duty with the new
detective should see me in my
office... otherwise I will choose a
volunteer myself. That is all.
He turns and heads back to his office in the wake of
continued grumbling from the detectives. Sykes, standing
to one side, absently watches Warner return to his glass-
walled office. Waiting inside are a balding man and an
alien in a grey suit. Sykes reacts. The alien in the
suit is Jetson.
The grumbling continues around him as Sykes considers
something.
FEDORCHUK
Unbelievable bullshit.
ALTEREZ
How long has this Slag been on the
force? A year, max -- right?
DETECTIVE
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit
still for this. I'm calling the
union, pronto.
Others grumble. ""Yeah!"". Meanwhile, Sykes has decided
something. He heads toward Warner's office. Fedorchuk
sees this.
FEDORCHUK
Where the hell is he going?
INT. WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY
Sykes KNOCKS and enters.
WARNER
Yeah, Sykes?
SYKES
Captain. I'd like to volunteer for
duty with the new detective.
Warner is surprised. He never expected Sykes.
WARNER
... All right. Detective Sergeant
Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson.
JETSON
We have met.
Warner looks up, clocking this. He looks at Sykes,
starting to smell something fishy.
The balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands.
GOLDRUP
Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office.
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Warner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to.
WARNER
(to Sykes)
You are to have nothing to do with
the investigation into Bill Tuggle's
death. You know that. Leave that
for Fedorchuk.
SYKES
(nodding)
Departmental policy.
WARNER
(to Jetson)
You?
JETSON
Yes, sir.
WARNER
Good.
SYKES
There's another case I'd like to
take. A homicide -- a Newcomer
named Hubley.
Jetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something.
Sykes avoids his look.
WARNER
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
SYKES
Granger and Pitts have one hell of a
caseload... and I would have thought
with Jetson here being the first
Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's
body being found over in the
Newcomer community...
WARNER
Don't tell me what to think.
GOLDRUP
He's got a point. That's the sort
of thing we should be doing with
this early advancement program...
Long-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally
sighs with resignation. Sykes grins.
CUT TO:
INT. STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
The steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit. Next
to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks
like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser. They move past all
the black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during:
SYKES
... and we work my hours. I'll do
the driving, you do the paperwork.
You gotta learn it so you might as
well do it all.
JETSON
(after a moment)
Sergeant... I'd like to thank you
for what you're doing.
SYKES
What's that?
(then realizing)
Look, Jetson. Get this straight in
your head. We're not pals, we're
not married, and we ain't gonna take
long moonlight walks together...
We're just partners. And don't call
me Sergeant. Call me Sykes... or
Matt if you have to.
JETSON
I am George.
Sykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half
steps to be exact. Then it hits Sykes. He seizes up
cold.
SYKES
Wait a minute. George? George
Jetson?
Jetson nods... he's used to this.
Sykes cracks up.
SYKES
(between laughs)
Man, somebody really hung one on
you! I've heard some good ones for
you guys... Humphrey Bogart, Harley
Davidson. I guess the people at
immigration got a little punchy
after a while, coming up with names
for a quarter of a million of you.
You weren't at the back of the line,
were you, George?
JETSON
My true name is Ss'tangya
T'ssorentsa'.
SYKES
Gesundheit. You don't mind if I
stick to George, do you?
EXT. POLICE STATION PARKING AREA - DAY
They approach Sykes' ugly sedan, the slug-mobile.
SYKES
Anyway, what's it matter to you if
we think it's funny, right? Whatta
you care?
JETSON
That is exactly so.
(completely deadpan)
It is like your name... Sykes. I'm
sure it doesn't bother you at all
that it sounds like ""ss'ai k'ss"",
two words in my language which mean
""excrement"" and ""cranium"".
Sykes looks at him, perplexed.
JETSON
""Shit... head"".
Jetson gets in and slams the door, leaving Sykes standing
there, the smirk dropping from his face.
CUT TO:
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - DAY
They're cruising along in downtown traffic. Sykes drives.
Jetson is somewhat cramped in the passenger seat.
SYKES
Let's talk Hubley.
JETSON
(refers to a folder
he holds)
His body was discovered three days
ago, in an alley off of Central
Avenue, near downtown.
SYKES
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the
chest.
JETSON
(gently correcting
him)
Through the chest. Rupturing both
the primary and secondary hearts.
SYKES
(out the window)
Nice signal, dickwad!
Jetson is momentarily thrown by this outburst from Sykes.
Then...
JETSON
He was employed at the Northwest
Petroleum Refinery in Torrance. He
was manager of the Methane Facility.
He was also a principle partner in a
real estate venture to develop low-
cost housing for Newcomers.
Sykes grimaces at the mention of ""Newcomer housing"".
SYKES
Terrific. A real pillar of the
community.
(beat)
Was Hubley missing anything when
they found him? Was he ripped off?
JETSON
(checks file)
There was no wallet... but he was
still wearing a watch and two rings.
SYKES
The guys at the mini-mart last night
made a half-assed stab at the money
in the till -- but I don't think
that's what they were there for. I
think we got us a couple'a
executions on our hands, George...
JETSON
The murder at the mini-mart is not
our case. The Captain said--
Sykes looks over at Jetson, pissed.
SYKES
Look, you want to fit in here,
right? You want to learn how to get
along?
JETSON
Yes.
SYKES
Well, there's a thing about
partners, about being somebody's
partner. You do for each other.
And other people's rules don't mean
shit. It's the rules set up between
the two of you, that's all that
counts. Understand?
(Jetson nods)
Okay. Well, my friend and partner
was shot last night and I'm after
the shitbag that did it. As my
partner, I'm asking you to respect
me and help me find him.
Jetson considers this several moments, then--
JETSON
And as my partner, I ask you to
respect me and my desire not to
break with procedure.
Sykes stares at him, exasperated. Without warning, he
slams the car to a stop right in the middle of heavy
traffic, puts it in ""Park."" Jetson, who is already a
little too close to the dashboard, bangs up against it.
HORNS instantly go crazy behind them.
JETSON
What is wrong?
SYKES
(very calm)
Nothing's wrong. I just want to get
something straight. You agree that
there's a good chance these two
shootings are somehow related,
right?
YELLING joins the HORNS outside. Jetson is visibly
unsettled by the chaos.
JETSON
Well... yes, quite possibly.
SYKES
Possibly. Good. Well, would you be
willing to accept the theory,
George, that... possibly... by
examining the evidence from one case
we might shed some small ray of
light on the other? Does that sound
unreasonable to you?
JETSON
Yes... no, it is not unreasonable.
Although I--
SYKES
Great.
(a relieved sigh)
Well, I'm sure glad that's settled,
aren't you?
And with that he puts the car in gear and pulls rapidly
out.
SYKES
I think we're really starting to
click now, George -- hmmm?
Jetson doesn't know what to think -- he just holds on.
CUT TO:
INT. HALLWAY - L.A. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY
WINTER, a deputy Medical Examiner (human), is leading
Sykes and Jetson along the hall. He reads on the fly from
a case file in his hand.
WINTER
You know I've been over all this
with Fedorchuk and Alterez this
morning...
SYKES
Come on. You got nothin' better to
do, cushy county job like yours.
INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY
They enter briskly through a swinging door. They move
among the tables (some occupied, some not) during:
WINTER
Yeah, right. Don't push your luck.
Anyway, according to the sheet, the
guy you nailed outside by the car--
SYKES
The human?
WINTER
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder.
White male, twenty-seven. Let's
see... wrap sheet shows one armed
robbery conviction, a couple for
sale of a controlled substance.
Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke
when you stopped his clock.
They have reached a table holding a covered body. Winter
unceremoniously throws back the cover. There lies the
pale naked body of the Raincoat alien.
JETSON
Have you identified this one?
WINTER
So far he's a John Doe. Or a Sam
Slag, if you like.
Jetson smiles slightly out of politeness.
WINTER
No I.D. on him and -- well, you
know, no fingerprints -- so it could
be tough. Your buddies this morning
went through the mug book but
couldn't make a facial match.
SYKES
Fedorchuk couldn't find his ass with
his hands in his back pockets.
Jetson nonchalantly looks over the alien body while Winter
and Sykes continue talking off to one side.
WINTER
(referring to
Raincoat alien)
You took this gut out, too, didn't
you?
SYKES
Yeah.
WINTER
Lucky for you, you got him in both
of his... well, what we loosely
refer to as... hearts.
SYKES
Lucky nothing. I had to empty my
damn gun into him.
WINTER
That's the way these people are.
You don't hit both pumps you just
piss them off.
During this, Jetson has turned the dead alien's hand over
-- sees something that brings a frown of curiosity to his
face. He leans closer, examining the palm carefully.
Then he peels back the alien's upper lip.
Jetson frowns anew, with concern this time. He looks
around, spots a Newcomer lab assistant nearby -- BENTNER.
Jetson motions him over. Jetson begins questioning him
using the alien language. Sykes and Winter nearby, remain
oblivious.
WINTER
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you
need one.
(hands Sykes a
polariod of dead
alien's face)
We're just about to start cutting
in. You're welcome to stick around
if you want. It's really
fascinating stuff.
SYKES
Yeah, I'll bet.
Sykes looks over, now noticing Jetson and Bentner in
earnest conversation. He only catches snatches of the
alien language. Bentner appears very unsettled by what
Jetson is telling him. In response to Jetson's final
statement, Bentner nods -- as if agreeing to do something
Jetson has requested. Sykes goes over to Jetson.
SYKES
What's this? What's going on?
JETSON
Nothing.
SYKES
(really suspicious
now)
Nothing?
JETSON
(looking away)
Shouldn't we examine their personal
effects?
Jetson moves off, leaving Sykes there wondering.
CUT TO:
INT. PROPERTY ROOM - COUNTY MORGUE - DAY
Two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents
onto a formica counter. Sykes looks through the dead
alien's effects while Jetson goes through the human's.
ORTIZ, the college girl working the property counter, sits
nearby doing homework.
Jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown.
JETSON
What is this?
SYKES
(looks, then)
A rubber. A condom. You know...
Coney Island whitefish?
(Jetson doesn't know
what one is)
Men, human men, put them on their,
uh -- penises -- to protect against
having babies.
(Jetson still doesn't
get it; Sykes turns
to Ortiz)
You need this for anything?
ORTIZ
Nope, got my own. Anything you guys
don't use gets stuffed away in
storage.
Sykes tears open the packet, unrolls the condom, dangles
it before Jetson.
SYKES
Get the picture?
JETSON
(frowning)
And that fits?
SYKES
Well... Yeah, it's rubber. It
stretches.
JETSON
And still it fits?
Sykes looks at Jetson's serious expression. He tosses the
condom and packet back into the counter and continues
searching. A beat, then he can't stop himself -- he
steals a glance at Jetson's crotch.
Still searching, Sykes picks up one of the dead alien's
well-worn heavy work boots. He grimaces... the sides and
soles are painted with a viscous black substance. He very
tentatively sniffs it... and is grateful that it's not
what he thought it might be.
SYKES
What is this stuff?
Sykes gets some on his hands, doesn't know where to wipe
it. Jetson glances over.
JETSON
It is a resin.
Sykes looks at him... surprised that he knows.
JETSON
(continuing)
Newcomers working near methane
gasses at oil refineries must paint
it on their boots to protect against
sparks.
SYKES
How the hell do you know that?
JETSON
A large number of my people were
hired by refineries because the
methane fumes are not harmful to us.
My spouse's brother is one.
SYKES
So the Slag they're cutting into
upstairs worked at a refinery just
like Hubley worked at a refinery.
(beat)
I'd say that ""possible"" connection
between the two cases just got a
hell of a lot more possible.
(beat)
Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk
to the wife of the Slag store owner
blown away last night.
JETSON
I believe I should interview the
widow alone.
SYKES
Why the hell--?!
(realizes it's
because of his lack
of ""bedside manner"")
Great, fine. You talk to the wife.
CUT TO:
INT./ EXT. MINI-MART - LATE AFTERNOON
The shattered windows have been covered with plywood.
Through the open doorway we see Jetson talking to the
Proprietor's Wife. She studies a photo Jetson shows her,
nods her head, speaking rapidly in the alien language.
CUT TO:
EXT. REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON
Sykes drives along beside the mammoth, steaming network of
buildings and pipes that make up the refinery.
CUT TO:
INT. REFINERY - LATE AFTERNOON
Through the loud and smoky refinery we see Sykes walking
with the newly promoted Methane Section manager, O'NEAL,
in tie and shirtsleeves. The workmen around them are both
human and Newcomer.
O'NEAL
(yelling over the
roar)
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy --
and a damn good manager. The men
liked him. I'm really gonna have to
scramble to fill his shoes.
SYKES
Well, one of the men didn't like him
so much...
They stop and Sykes hands O'Neal the polariod photo of
Raincoat alien. They have stopped near the heavy
refrigeration-type door leading to the ""METHANE SECTION"".
Newcomer workers move in and out through the door during:
O'NEAL
(looking at photo)
You think this is the guy who did
it?
SYKES
We think he could'a been involved,
yeah. You know him?
O'NEAL
To be honest, it's hard to say. I
hate to admit it but -- they all
still kinda look alike to me.
SYKES
(impatient)
Who else can I ask around here?
O'NEAL
(looking at photo
again)
Wait. You know who it looks like?
Yeah. Anderson. Uh... James
Anderson. He isn't in today. He
took the afternoon off.
SYKES
I think you're gonna find he's taken
the rest of his life off.
O'Neal reacts. Sykes notices the door to the Methane
Section.
SYKES
That where Anderson worked?
O'NEAL
Yes it is.
(some alien workers
come through the
door)
Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas
in there. I don't know how these
fellas do it.
Sykes watches two more alien workers pass back through the
door. O'Neal watches Sykes' expression for signs of
suspicion.
CUT TO:
HIGH ANGLE SHOT - SYKES AND O'NEAL
We see Sykes hand O'Neal a card, then move off. O'Neal
watches him briefly, then crosses to some steps and starts
up this way.
We PAN with him as he enters a door here on the second
level.
CUT TO:
INT. METHANE SECTION CONTROL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
O'Neal enters, moves to a telephone, begins to dial.
Beyond is a glass wall overlooking the Methane Section.
CUT TO:
ANGLE - BELOW
CAMERA TRACKS through the Methane Section... past the
alien workers in lab whites... past all the arcane
equipment and chemical procedures... ending in an EXTREME
CLOSE UP of a small cylindrical dispenser as it fills
slowly with a pale blue, viscous liquid.
CUT TO:
INT./ EXT. SLUG-MOBILE - JETSON'S STREET - DUSK
We're SHOOTING THROUGH the slug-mobile window as Sykes
pulls up in front of Jetson's modest but immaculately
maintained home on the outskirts of Slagtown. Jetson's
WIFE, an attractive alien woman, stands watering the lawn
with a garden hose. Jetson's son, age six, rides his
bicycle along the walkway. Jetson, dressed in his suit
for work, crouches near the walkway, playing with his son.
Sykes pulls the car toward the curb, rolls his eyes.
SYKES
Jesus. Welcome back Ozzie and
Harriet...
He HONKS the horn. Jetson looks up, then moves to his
wife and kisses her goodbye. Moves to his son, kisses him
on the top of his head.
Sykes watches all this... and as he does, slowly his
derisive expression softens. As corny as this tableau may
be, there's something very appealing about the innocence
of it... even to an unrepentant cynic like Sykes.
Jetson starts to climb into the car, and we--
CUT TO:
INT. RESTROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT
CLOSE on an alien hand as it removes one of the drug
dispensers from a tuxedo pocket. As the hand brings the
dispenser toward the face, we immediately recognize the
exotic silver bracelet worn by Kipling the night before.
It makes that distinctive CLINKING NOISE. We PAN with the
hand to reveal Kipling's face... sans bandana and
sunglasses now. He wears a black tuxedo. He lets a small
dab of the blue gel curl from the dispenser onto his
tongue. He swallows... and reacts as the rush from the
drug hits him.
The door to the men's room bangs open and a MIDDLE AGED
POLITICO enters, obviously drunk.
Kipling quickly pockets the dispenser, moves past the
Politico to the exit...
CUT TO:
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
Sykes drives, heading for the Biltmore Hotel.
JETSON
Mrs. Porter is not taking her
husband's death well.
SYKES
(impatient)
Did you learn anything?
JETSON
A week ago two men came to see her
husband. After they left, he was
very frightened. She identified one
of the men from a photo I showed
her. It was Hubley.
SYKES
Aw-right. What about the other guy?
JETSON
She didn't know him. But she said
her son might.
SYKES
Did you talk to him?
JETSON
He has not been home since that day.
But she told me where to find him.
Sykes nods.
CUT TO:
INT. MAIN BALLROOM - BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT
The men are in tuxedos, the women in evening gowns. Only
two of three Newcomers faces present. Kipling threads his
way among the tables as the MAYOR, at the speaker's
platform, addresses the assembly.
MAYOR
... Our guest speaker tonight has
done so much in his community and
for his community in such a short
period of time. And I must say, as
the founder of the first Newcomer
owned and operated corporation in
Southern California, he certainly
has come quite far in the last few
years. Granted, not as far as he
came in the years before reaching
Los Angeles.
There is laughter from the VIPs. Kipling slides into a
seat at one of the front tables. He leans over and
whispers something into the ear of the person seated to
his right. We see this CLOSE UP, and don't see who he is
whispering to yet. Whoever it is, nods.
MAYOR
(continuing)
As Mayor of this city, it gives me
great pleasure to introduce someone
who has so readily made our city
his home... and all of us who live
here, his friends. Ladies and
gentlemen, William Harcourt.
The VIPs applaud as the spotlight sweeps over to a front
table. At first it hits Kipling, then it adjusts to
capture WILLIAM HARCOURT, seated to Kipling's right.
Harcourt is an exemplar of the successful Newcomer
entrepreneur... handsome, charming, with cool blue eyes
that glint with his piercing intellect. He rises, smiling
warmly, steps past his striking ALIEN DATE seated to his
right, to make his way to the podium. He shields his eyes
somewhat from the bright spotlight.
Once behind the podium, he slips his notes from a breast
pocket as the applause ebbs.
HARCOURT
Thank you all for that very warm
reception.
(pauses, smiles)
I'm particularly grateful because I
actually had the gall to write that
in my notes: ""Thank you all for that
very warm reception"". Imagine how
embarrassed I would've been if it
hadn't have been such a warm
reception.
The VIPs laugh. He's won them over instantly with his
charm and candor.
CUT TO:
INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT
Sykes, followed by a reluctant Jetson, bears down on
Harcourt, who is exiting the hotel with his Date, and
Kipling. We see Kipling recognize Sykes from their fight
two nights before... but because Kipling looks so
different, Sykes doesn't recognize him outright. Still,
during this, Sykes senses something, though he's not sure
what.
SYKES
William Harcourt?
HARCOURT
Yes...
SYKES
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is
Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police
Department.
HARCOURT
(nodding greeting)
Sergeant... Detective. I wasn't
aware there were any Newcomers at
the rank of Detective yet.
JETSON
I am the first.
HARCOURT
Congratulations. This is my
administrative assistant, Rudyard
Kipling.
SYKES
(throw away)
Rudyard Kipling? No shit?
(to Harcourt)
Listen, we just need a minute of
your time...
JETSON
We'd like to ask you about a
business associate of your, Warren
Hubley.
HARCOURT
Yes, I heard about poor Warren.
Tragic.
SYKES
You were partners with him on some
Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate
thing.
HARCOURT
That's right. He and I, along with
seven or eight others. Listen,
gentlemen, I will be happy to assist
you in any way I can --
unfortunately, at the moment, I'm
overdue at another function.
Suddenly there's a voice from O.S.:
MAYOR (O.S.)
William...
Harcourt turns as the Mayor and his WIFE step up.
HARCOURT
Mr. Mayor...
MAYOR
William, I was wondering if you
wouldn't rather ride with Luisa and
me. Two limousines trying to make
it across town in all this traffic,
we're bound to be later than we
already are.
HARCOURT
Excellent idea. Ray, I wonder if
you know two of your police
officers... Detective Jetson and
Sykes.
MAYOR
(shaking their hands,
dismissively)
A pleasure.
(to Harcourt)
We really should be going.
The wind is knocked from Sykes' sails by the presence of
the Mayor with a very impatient expression. Harcourt
smiles.
HARCOURT
(continuing)
Please feel free to call my office
Monday morning for an appointment.
(to Jetson)
Congratulations again on your
promotion, Detective. Remember...
you're out there setting an example
in our community. I'll be keeping
an eye on you.
Harcourt is smiling as he says this last, but his eyes are
penetrating... telegraphing a subliminal warning.
Harcourt and entourage move off... leaving Sykes steaming.
CUT TO:
EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - HARCOURT AND KIPLING - NIGHT
Walking behind the others. They speak in very low voices;
Harcourt continuing to nod and smile to other passing VIPs
during:
KIPLING
That cop, the human, he was the one
who killed Anderson and the driver.
HARCOURT
This is becoming a serious breach of
security.
KIPLING
He didn't recognize me.
HARCOURT
It is his new partner that I'm
worried about.
CUT TO:
INT. POLICE FIRING RANGE - FRONT DESK - NIGHT
MAFFET, the stocky retired cop behind the counter, hands
Jetson a bag of reloads and some silhouette targets.
Sykes nods to Jetson, motioning him toward the firing
line.
SYKES
Go on ahead. I'll be right in.
(to Maffet, low)
What'd you dig up for me?
Maffet slides open a drawer, takes out a paper bag
containing a massive pistol with an enormous bore. By
his manner this deal is definitely not kosher. Sykes
hefts the weapon.
MAFFET
You said you wanted the biggest
thing I could find... Well, this is
it.
SYKES
What is it?
MAFFET
Casull .454 Magnum. You're talking
twice the impact energy of .44
Magnum hot loads.
SYKES
(flips open cylinder)
Only holds five.
MAFFET
Yeah, the shells are too big for six
in an cylinder. Hell, Matt, you
don't need but one.
SYKES
(sighting)
No... two.
EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - FIRING LINE - NIGHT
Jetson, looking bizarre in his ear-protectors, is taking
careful aim with his .38 as Sykes walks up. Jetson slips
the protectors down.
SYKES
Well, let's see what you got,
Cochise. Gimme six, rapid fire.
Jetson, a little nervous at this command performance,
turns, sets, and FIRES at the silhouette target. It's a
large, sloppy grouping.
SYKES
(continuing)
How long you been shooting? That's
pitiful. Whattya gonna do if
somebody draws down on you, wave
your scores on the written exam at
'em?
Sykes starts loading the thumb-sized bullets into the
Casull.
JETSON
Why did you do it?
SYKES
Why'd I do what?
JETSON
Agree to work with me? You don't
like me... you don't like any of us.
You have nothing but contempt for
us. And yet you become an outcast
from your club of detectives by
making me your partner...
SYKES
My partner is dead! Because one of
you bastards killed him -- then
disappeared into a rathole down in
Slagtown, where he's home and dry,
'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody
says nothing...
Sykes grabs a bullet-proof vest from nearby, slaps it onto
the hanging target form. He hits the switch, running the
target down to the end of the lane.
SYKES
(continuing)
But he didn't figure on you, George.
You're going to get me through that
wall of silence. You're going to
make them talk to me. You're going
to help me find that Slag son-of-a-
bitch. Comprendo? And if Fedorchuk
and the boys in the bullpen don't
like it, screw them... and if the
Captain doesn't like it, screw
him... and if all the Slags down in
Slagtown don't like it... well screw
them too!
Sykes raises the Casull, fires. KA-BOOM!!! The shell
rockets clean through the bullet-proof vest on the target
form. The recoil slams Sykes back, jerks his arm up. KA-
BOOM!!! again, and another hole is drilled through the
vest. Other shooters look over. Sykes sets the gun
down... sees his hand is bleeding. Jetson absorbs all
this, as we--
CUT TO:
EXT. ""X"" BAR - NIGHT
A violet neon ""X"" FILLS FRAME, flashing hypnotically.
It's a bar catering to rough-trade Newcomer clientele.
Several ALIEN MEN, brute laborer-types, lounge around out
front. They glare with antagonism as Sykes and Jetson
climb out of their car.
SYKES
(to Jetson)
Okay, just stay back and do what I
do. Watch and learn, watch and
learn...
INT. ""X"" BAR - NIGHT
Sykes and Jetson walk into the almost total blackness of
this all-Newcomer place.
A few near-infrared indigo lamps dot the blackness.
SYKES
I can't see dick in here.
We can dimly make out booths along one wall, some tables,
and the bar. There are maybe twenty figures seated or
standing in the darkness. The room falls silent in a wave
as Sykes' presence becomes noticed.
Sykes saunters forward, commanding the space with his
unhurried movements.
SYKES
(calling into the
dark silence)
Which one'a you Slags is Porter?
VOICE
(from the back of
the bar)
Who wants to know?
Sykes squints into the darkness, then--
SYKES
(aside to Jetson)
Who said that?
JETSON
(tilts his head to
indicate)
At the end of the bar.
Sykes nods, starts in that direction.
SYKES
My name is Sykes. I'm--
ALIEN VOICE
Ss'ai k'ss?
The whole place roars with LAUGHTER. Too late Sykes
remembers what his name sounds like to them. He continues
down the bar and a figure in one of the booths sticks his
leg out and trips Sykes with his size 16 work boot. Sykes
stumbles, then recovers and pivots on the offender. Hoots
and derisive LAUGHTER. He sees only shadows.
OFFENDER
(merely a voice in
the dark)
Careful, ss'loka', you might hurt
yourself.
More laughter. Sykes gives the darkness where the
offender sits a hard stare, then turns and shoulders his
way to the end of the bar. Jetson follows. Sykes stops
behind a big Newcomer in greasy work clothes.
ANGLE
The punk Newcomer in the next seat is keeping his head
down, trying to be inconspicuous.
He glances over at the two cops... his expression shifting
to recognition as he spots Jetson.
BACK TO SCENE
Sykes speaks to the Big Newcomer's back.
SYKES
You Porter?
The Big Newcomer continues to sip his mug of sour milk.
Doesn't turn. Sykes grabs him by the shoulder and turns
him around. The alien grabs Sykes' hand off, rising to
his full height. He and Sykes lock eyes. Meanwhile. the
punk Newcomer (PORTER) has started to slip away unnoticed.
Jetson spots him, reaches out with one arm, and grabs him
by the jacket.
JETSON
No, Matthew. I believe this is the
one you want.
He pulls Porter back into play. Now Jetson sees Porter's
face... and he, too, reacts with recognition.
Sykes gives Jetson a sour look, releases the Big Newcomer,
and turns his malice on the punk Newcomer.
SYKES
Your name wouldn't happen to be
Porter, would it?
JETSON
Uh, Matthew...
SYKES
(over his shoulder
to Jetson)
Back off, George.
JETSON
But I-- (know this man).
SYKES
I'll handle it.
Jetson backs off, letting him handle it.
SYKES
(to Porter)
Jesus, are the questions too tough
for you already? Let's try again--
(slowly)
Is your name Porter?
PORTER
Ss'kya'ta'.
SYKES
(to Jetson)
What's that?
JETSON
Screw you.
SYKES
(back to Porter)
Screw me? That can't be right.
PORTER
Ss'kya ta' ss'loka'. Ss'trokya'
ss'lato na'!
JETSON
(to Sykes, low)
You don't want to know.
SYKES
Tell me.
JETSON
Your mother mates out of season.
SYKES
(to Porter)
That's very colorful. But see --
now I've got a problem. I don't
seem to be getting much cooperation
from you, Porter. So I guess we're
gonna have to take this little
session down to my office, ya
know?
And instantly Sykes whips out this flashlight, snaps on
the beam, and arcs it into the faces of the aliens around
him. Jetson gets a blast of it, too. The aliens are
momentarily blinded.
Sykes has Porter pinned to the bar, the flashlight in his
face, as he starts to handcuff him. But Porter gets a
hand free and crushes the head of the flashlight.
Darkness falls... along with Sykes' expression of
satisfaction.
Porter hurls Sykes back, slamming him into a table. The
crowd HOOTS and CHEERS. Sykes finds his way to his feet.
JETSON
Matthew, you don't have to-- (do this).
SYKES
Stay back! I'm okay.
He charges Porter, brandishing the flashlight like a club.
The two of them battle, then Sykes sees his opportunity
and brings his knee up viciously into the alien's groin.
Porter doubles over in feigned agony, then slowly rises
again -- smiling.
PORTER
Don't they teach you anything about
us in cop school, little ss'loka'?
Porter grabs Sykes by the shirt front, is about to deliver
a crushing blow, when another arm cuts into FRAME, locking
with Porter's, blocking the punch. It is Jetson.
JETSON
Enough.
PORTER
(eyeing Jetson)
Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'. You're a
cop.
(with some contempt)
It fits you.
Jetson says something to him in the alien language.
Porter gives him a hard stare, then moves toward the back
exit. Sykes stumbles over to Jetson.
SYKES
You know that guy?
JETSON
(nods)
From quarantine, when my people
first arrived here. He and I were
housed together.
SYKES
How could a straight-arrow like you
ever pick a roommate like him?
JETSON
In the camps, we were lodged four to
a room. The selection process was
entirely random. We did not get to
stay with our friends... or
families...
And he moves toward the back exit. Sykes watches him go.
CUT TO:
EXT. ""X"" BAR - NIGHT
Porter leans against an alley wall. He speaks English
learned on the streets.
JETSON
You don't know what your father and
these two men were arguing about?
PORTER
I told you -- I was in the back of
the store. I just heard voices,
muffled like.
SYKES
One of the two men was Hubley,
right? What about the other one?
Did you know him?
PORTER
Yeah... I seen him around. High-
roller dude named Strader. Joshua
Strader. Runs a club on the west
side. Encounters.
SYKES
Yeah, I heard of it.
PORTER
That's all I know. You want
anything more, you ask somebody
else.
He pushes away from the wall, heads for the door to the
bar.
JETSON
I am sorry about your father.
Porter throws him a look over his shoulder, then
disappears through the door. Sykes and Jetson start down
the alley.
JETSON
If I may make a suggestion... We
have different weak spots than you
do. Next time, a blow to the nerve
plexus under the arm, here, will
produce the effect I think you were
looking for.
SYKES
Yeah, sure. I knew that...
CUT TO:
EXT. BURGER STAND - NIGHT
The wall-mounted menu is in English and the Alien
Language. The SERVERS are teen aged humans and aliens.
Sykes and Jetson stand at the counter awaiting their
order.
KID
(serving them)
Six forty-two.
They both put money on the counter. The kid goes to put
the order together. Sykes looks at the alien characters
on the menu.
SYKES
I don't think I could ever learn to
read that shit.
(beat)
How long did it take you to learn
English?
JETSON
Three months.
(off Sykes' look)
We learn quickly. We adapt. It is
our strength... what we were bred
for, to adapt to hostile
environments.
The Serving Kid puts their bags on the counter.
JETSON
(continuing)
Thank you.
They take the bags and walk off, digging the food out of
the bags as they talk:
SYKES
My neighbor's kid has a Newcomer
girl in his class. She's six years
old and in seventh grade already...
They climb into the car.
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
Jetson doesn't respond... some things are better left
unaddressed. Meanwhile, Sykes has unwrapped his food and
recoils in disgust.
SYKES
Oh, God. I think I got yours
here...
He holds up two strips of raw meat with patches of animal
fur still on them. Jetson meanwhile is grimacing at the
dripping cheeseburger he's just unwrapped. They quickly
trade.
SYKES
(continuing)
Which one is that? Raw what?
JETSON
(eating a strip)
This is mole. It's good.
SYKES
I'll bet.
(winces, watching him
chew)
Would it really put you out if they
tossed that on the grill for a
minute or two?
JETSON
Our bodies do not assimilate the
nutrients if the food has been
cooked.
Jetson looks over at him, smiling.
SYKES
Oh, that's real attractive. You got
fur in your teeth, George. Come on,
man, we're gonna be talking to
people... jeez.
Sykes looks at his burger, his appetite gone, shoves it
back into the sack and tosses it into the back seat.
INT./ EXT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
As Sykes pulls onto the street.
SYKES
So what was that other word for
Human... Slow ka?
JETSON
Ss'loka'. It means literally ""small
but intelligent creature"".
(Sykes looks over,
doesn't know if he
likes this)
It loses much in the translation.
SYKES
And what was that one about my
mother? That was a good one.
JETSON
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
SYKES
Yeah, that's it. Say it slow.
Jetson pronounces the words and Sykes follows along
haltingly. After several tries, he can say it passably
well.
INT. ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
An upscale, mostly yuppie-human dance club. The
antithesis of the ""X"" bar. A human HOSTESS in a slit
dress has just finished seating Sykes and Jetson at a
table. She moves off. The two cops look up at the stage.
REVERSE ANGLE
revealing the exotic alien dancer named CASSANDRA. She
moves with a feline blend of strength and grace. Framing
her face is a silvery nylon wig that she tosses like a
mane as she undulates to the MUSIC.
Sykes watches with fascination. The MUSIC ends and
Cassandra steps down from the stage, to be replaced by a
human DANCER as the next SONG cranks up. Sykes and Jetson
quickly intercept her as she heads backstage.
JETSON
You are Cassandra?
CASSANDRA
That's right.
JETSON
We are with the Police Department.
This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
CASSANDRA
(laughing)
Ss'ai k'ss? Perfect.
SYKES
We're looking for your boss --
Strader.
She eyes the two of them warily, then moves backstage,
assuming they will follow.
INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
She moves along the narrow corridor.
CASSANDRA
He's not here. Why ask me?
JETSON
The young woman at the front said
you might know where he is.
CASSANDRA
She did, did she? Well, she was
wrong. Excuse me, I have to change.
SYKES
No problem.
She moves through a door. Sykes follows closely so does
Jetson.
INT. ENCOUNTERS - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
Cassandra grabs some clothes and goes into a stall.
SYKES
Look, we're not here doing an
interview for the school paper.
This is a homicide investigation...
and if you don't stop jerkin' us
around, I'm ready to start playin'
hardball.
Jetson has waited politely half-in half-out of the room.
Sykes rapidly motions to him to ""go look around"". Jetson
mimes back, ""Huh?""
CASSANDRA
(slipping out of her
dance costume)
Oooh. Hardball. That sounds
interesting. Are you going to
strike me? You could tie me up and
then do whatever you want with me...
I've got my own ropes.
SYKES
(still miming to
Jetson)
Does that cost extra or you throw
them in?
CASSANDRA
You've got me all wrong. I don't
charge money for something that I
myself find pleasurable...
Finally Jetson gets what Sykes is trying to tell him. He
says in the uncertain, stagy voice of a bad liar:
JETSON
I am going out to the car. I will
meet you there.
Sykes rolls his eyes as Jetson exits into the corridor.
Cassandra emerges from the stall, wearing a long, stylish,
low-cut dress.
CASSANDRA
Look, I don't know where Mr.
Strader might be. He comes and he
goes.
SYKES
(starting to feel a
little uncomfortable)
The girl out front mentioned
Strader's assistant, somebody named
Watson. Maybe he knows.
CASSANDRA
(tensing slightly)
Todd? Todd doesn't know either.
She is very close to Sykes now. She fingers the lapel of
his jacket.
CASSANDRA
(continuing)
I know... Why don't you hang around
for a while, let me entertain you?
It's Matt, right? Now tell me the
truth, have you ever... made it...
with one of us?
SYKES
Not unless I got real drunk and
nobody told me about it later.
CASSANDRA
A virgin. I find that very
arousing...
INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
MUSIC drifts up from downstairs. Jetson moves along the
corridor, scoping things out. He tries a door. Locked.
Tries another one. Open. He eases it wider, then enters
the darkened office.
INT. OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT
Jetson moves into the office. Looks around. Makes his
way to the cluttered desk top. Pushes things around...
all the usual stuff. He starts to turn away, then his eye
catches something sticking out from behind a row of ledger
books. He reaches for it. A small dispenser -- of the
kind we saw being filled at the refinery. Jetson studies
it, his suspicions growing. Opening it, he finds only the
barest trace of a viscous substance.
He smells it... not enough to tell for certain what it is.
But enough that he is very concerned about what it could
be.
INT. CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
Cassandra is practically melting herself into Sykes now.
She takes his hand and guides his fingertips over her
facial ridges. She shudders with pleasure. Sykes begins
to perspire.
SYKES
There's lots of things I haven't
done, but his ain't high on the
list. Don't take it personally.
CASSANDRA
I think you're just a little scared
now, about what you might find once
the lights go out. A little
scared... and a lot curious. Maybe
more than you want to admit. But
doesn't that turn you on, that
curiosity and fear, swirling
together?
(coos)
Think of it as broadening your
horizons.
SYKES
I like my horizons narrow.
CASSANDRA
(pressing herself
into him)
Your voice is saying no, but your
body is saying yes.
He quickly disengages from her.
SYKES
My voice, body, and everything else
is saying I'll be back in two hours
for Strader, and he better damn well
be here.
He shoves a business card at her, then retreats through
the door.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Sykes closes the door and lets out his breath.
INT. CASSANDRA'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
Cassandra's expression instantly turns to worry and she
quickly crosses to a phone and punches the intercom
button.
INT. OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT
Jetson, looking through a desk drawer, hears the intercom
BUZZ in the next room. Through the wall--
WATSON (O.S.)
(tentatively)
Yes...?
CASSANDRA (O.S.)
(over the intercom,
breathless)
Todd, it's me. The police were just
here... looking for Strader. And
asking about you.
Jetson moves toward the door to the adjoining office,
drawing his gun. The floor squeaks beneath his feet. He
looks down, then continues toward the door.
INT. OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT
Jetson eases open the door. It's the manager's private
office. Jetson sees the phone receiver resting on the
desk, the desk lamp on, a lit cigarette in an ashtray --
but no one behind the desk. Jetson eases through the door
and--
-- a chair crashes down on him from behind the door!
Jetson goes down, his gun skittering out of his hand.
INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT
Jetson and his assailant battle in the well-appointed
office.
INT. OFFICE - SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Sykes hears the fight through the private office door.
He throws the door open.
INT. PRIVATE OFFICE - NIGHT
Sykes stands in the doorway, the Casull straight-armed at
Jetson's assailant.
SYKES
Freeze! Now!
The assailant does. He looks at Sykes, scared, breathing
hard. He's a Newcomer in a snappy Armani suit. This is
TODD WATSON. Jetson, on the floor, starts to rise.
Suddenly somebody flies at Sykes from the side, knocking
him sideways down the corridor. It's Cassandra. Watson
seizes the moment and shoves the off-balance Jetson into
some furniture and dives for the door.
INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Watson runs down the corridor, ducking onto a fire escape.
Meanwhile Sykes wrestles with Cassandra. She's as strong
as he is, but he has the edge in experience.
Jetson, disheveled, appears in the private office doorway,
ready to chase Watson, but not knowing which way he went.
SYKES
(struggling with
Cassandra)
Fire escape! End of the hall!
Jetson nods, takes off down the corridor. Sykes manges to
get one handcuff on Cassandra's wrist, the other cuff
around a pipe sticking out of the wall. She SCREECHES at
him in the alien language as he collects the Casull and
charges down the corridor.
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
Jetson pounds down the fire escape. Below him, he sees
Watson reach the ground and take off running for the
parking area.
Jetson reaches the ground and gives chase.
EXT. ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Watson zig-zags through the parked cars, Jetson cutting
down other rows trying to make up the distance between
them.
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - OUTSIDE ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
Sykes bangs down the fire escape, leaping the last fifteen
feet to the ground.
EXT. ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Watson reaches his Alfa Romeo, yanks open the door, fires
it up. Jetson slides up, ten feet behind the car, pulls
his gun, aims.
The white reverse-lights flash on. Jetson stands there,
gun aimed -- but he hesitates to shoot. In that split
second hesitation, Watson floors it... Jetson jumping to
avoid being hit.
INT. ALFA ROMEO - NIGHT
Watson throws the car into Drive, looks up, and sees Sykes
standing right in front of the car. He hits the gas.
Sykes has no choice then to leap onto the hood of the car.
Watson, with Sykes' face on the other side of the glass,
panics and--
EXT. ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
-- plows the Alfa into some parked cars.
Sykes is up in a flash -- yanks Watson out of the car.
Watson rears back to swing at Sykes, when Sykes swings his
arms around in two wide arcs, his fists landing two direct
hits in the nerve centers under Watson's arms. Watson
folds over with a ""ooowwph"" sound and drops to his knees.
SYKES
(breathing hard)
I'll be damned. It worked.
(sees Jetson run up)
How'd you like that, huh? Whammo!
Both barrels. Dropped him like a
bag of cement.
Jetson picks up Watson's fallen wallet. He looks at the
I.D.
SYKES
Who is he?
JETSON
Todd Watson. The assistant manager.
Watson is still doubled over, just trying to draw one
agonized breath.
WATSON
I don't believe this. Look at my
suit. Look at what you made me do
to my car.
SYKES
(laughing)
Your girlfriend put up a better
fight than you did, pal.
JETSON
We are looking for your employer,
Joshua Strader.
WATSON
He's out of town.
JETSON
Why did you run?
WATSON
Because you two were chasing me.
SYKES
We were chasing you because you ran,
you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
JETSON
When will Strader return?
WATSON
Who knows. He's the boss -- he
doesn't have to check in with me.
SYKES
(wearily)
Watson... this is my partner here's
first coupla days, and he wants to
make a good impression. Me, though,
the way I feel -- this could be my
last day, know what I mean? And I'm
ready to rain on you like a cow
pissin' on a flat rock.
WATSON
Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been
around for a coupla days. He didn't
tell me where he was going or when
he'd be back. I swear it.
SYKES
(to Jetson)
What do you think?
JETSON
I believe he is probably lying.
SYKES
Through his ass.
(to Watson)
Next time you see him, tell him to
call me... unless you want us to
keep coming back on you like a bad
case of herpes.
Sykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket.
They walk away and Watson slumps against his car.
ANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON
as they walk wearily to the slug-mobile.
SYKES
George, you can handle the women
from now on, you mind?
CUT TO:
EXT. ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Watson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he
hears footsteps. He turns with a ""What now?"" expression
and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead. He
goes down. Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN
THUGS. One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's
employ.
QUINT
(to other Thugs)
Okay, scrape him up.
CUT TO:
EXT. ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT
Harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access
road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs.
The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d.
van.
Harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back
of the van. Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three
human Thugs.
They have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing
the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron.
He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious.
HARCOURT
Any progress?
QUINT
My arm's gettin' tired and so far,
zip.
KIPLING
He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to
Strader.
QUINT
What's that mean?
KIPLING
Duty-bonded. His allegiance to
Strader is above pain or life.
QUINT
You tellin' me this guy would die
before he'd screw his boss and work
for us? Nobody's that dumb.
KIPLING
It is something you couldn't
comprehend, Quint.
Harcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to
keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand.
HARCOURT
I understand you have been resisting
my offer Mr. Watson. Your sense of
duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but --
no longer an issue, I'm afraid...
Harcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from
the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot
twice through the front of his silk suit. Watson's eyes
widen in fear.
HARCOURT
(continuing)
I will not make this offer again. I
want you to work for me, to manage
the nightclub as Strader's successor.
If you do, you will know a wealth
and comfort our people never dared
imagine...
Watson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant.
WATSON
Sss'k'a ta'!
Harcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring
his resolve. Then--
HARCOURT
It is such a pity to die for an
outmoded value.
(rising)
Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for
our friend's swimming lesson.
Watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains.
HARCOURT
(to Watson)
It's important to learn new skills.
Essential to your growth as a
person.
Quint and the Thugs free Watson from the bumper. He bucks
and lunges as they drag him toward the surf. Quint
addresses one of the Thugs, a new guy.
QUINT
You never seen this before, have
you, Billy? oh, man, you ain't
gonna believe it... seawater is like
battery acid to these guys... I
don't know what it is, some kinds
chemical reaction. Whatta you think
it is, Watson? Whoa, hold him.
(a wave breaks
outside, the foam
rolls in)
What I love about the surf is you
can never tell how far up it's going
to come until it... whoops, got a
little wet there.
The wave just sloshes over Watson's lower legs. He
screams. Flailing, one of his hands dips below the
surface of the water. He howls and yanks out his hand.
We see the alien hand dripping seawater... then a thousand
droplets of purple alien blood begin to bead all over the
hand. The Thugs get Watson swinging.
QUINT
Last call, sucker. One... two...
THREE!
Watson is flung into the surf.
ANGLE
Harcourt and Kipling have walked down almost to the
waterline. We HEAR Watson's GURGLES and SCREAMS... then
nothing. Kipling is very nervous this close to the water.
Harcourt seems unperturbed.
KIPLING
When we picked him up, he was
talking to those two cops -- the two
who came to question you about
Hubley.
HARCOURT
This is getting out of hand. I want
you to deal with it. Immediately.
A wave rushes up the sand. Kipling quickly steps back.
Harcourt stands firm, staring it down, and the foam stops
six inches from his dress shoes.
HARCOURT
(continuing)
We must learn to embrace the things
we fear... and from that grow
strong.
A moment, then he turns and starts back toward the limo.
He motions to Strader's body and the surf. The Thugs grab
the body and heave it into the waves.
CUT TO:
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Jetson is talking rapidly in the alien language on the
kitchen wall phone. Sykes, foreground, takes the bottle
of vodka from the refrigerator, throws some ice in a
glass, pours himself a shot. As Jetson is talking, he
spots the carton of milk that Sykes inadvertently left out
of the refrigerator two nights ago.
He sniffs it... his eyebrows do an involuntary movement.
He finishes with his wife and hangs up. He watches Sykes
take a long pull on the vodka.
JETSON
(holds up milk
carton)
Would you mind?
Sykes shrugs, tosses him a glass. Jetson pours the semi-
lumpy milk and takes a big swallow. Sykes grimaces.
Then--
SYKES
(indicates phone)
So, she keeps you on a pretty short
leash, does she?
JETSON
My wife? She worries about me.
Sykes leans against the counter, getting comfortable, his
voice more weary then bitter.
SYKES
Yeah... I know the routine.
JETSON
You are married?
SYKES
Was. Divorced.
JETSON
We mate for life. Divorce... is a
strange concept to us.
SYKES
It's like having an eleventh finger
removed. It hurts like hell, but
you never really needed the damn
thing in the first place.
Jetson nods -- even though he doesn't really understand
this. They drink... Jetson gazes around.
JETSON
Your home is quite disordered. I
thought perhaps you had been
burglarized when I walked in.
SYKES
(growling)
I appreciate your honesty, George.
He smacks his glass against Jetson's. They drink.
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER
Sykes has his wallet out... showing Jetson a dog-eared
photo.
SYKES
Ignore the bitch on the left, that's
Edie. I call her Edi Amin... This
is Kristin, my daughter. It's kinda
an old picture... she's twenty now.
Getting married, in fact... on
Sunday.
Jetson sitting across the table from Sykes, looks at the
proffered photo. They're both a little drunk now.
JETSON
Human children can be very
beautiful.
(then)
Getting married? Congratulations.
You will be taking Sunday off,
then...
SYKES
(uneasy)
Maybe not... I don't know. I'm not
sure I'm gonna go.
(mumbles)
She doesn't need her burn-out of a
father there...
Jetson looks at him. Sees something he never thought
possible in Sykes. Vulnerability. Trying to break the
melancholy mood, Jetson reaches for his wallet.
JETSON
(upbeat)
I must show you...
(flips open wallet,
shows four crisp
photos of his wife)
And this is Richard. My son. He's
four years old. We named him after
the former President, Richard Nixon.
Sykes looks at all the photos sprawled out on the table...
and has to laugh. He looks up at Jetson's sincere face.
He may be starting to like this guy.
SYKES
You open to a piece of advice? Tell
people you named him after Richard
Burton, the actor. Just take my
word for it.
And he clacks his glass against Jetson's sitting on the
table, and--
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER
They are quite a bit drunker. Jetson has doffed his
jacket and tie, leans in, listening intently to Sykes.
SYKES
... and so, and so the doctor says,
""If this is the thermometer, then
where'd I leave the pen?""
(laughs raucously,
Jetson doesn't
react)
You're not... you don't think that's
funny? George, work with me, I
always get a laugh with that one.
Look, if the doctor's got the
thermometer in his hand, then
where's his pen gotta be?
JETSON
(straight-faced)
In the other man's rectum.
SYKES
(laughing)
Sticking out of his ass... yeah!
See, that's what makes it a joke.
There's like a surprise, and your
mind fills in the funny picture.
Here's this guy with a pen stuck in
his ass and he thinks it's a
thermometer.
(Jetson just blinks)
Nada, huh?
Jetson shrugs apologetically. Sykes pours them each
another round.
SYKES
(continuing)
Your health...
JETSON
Ta ss'trakyona'...
They CLACK glasses, and--
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - LATER STILL
The party has moves into the living room floor, around the
coffee table. It's a quieter moment.
JETSON
There is so much our two peoples
don't understand about each other.
SYKES
No shit, Holmes. You're only from
another goddamn planet, for
chrissakes.
JETSON
You humans are very curious to us.
You invite us to live among you, in
an atmosphere of equality we've
never known before. You lay before
us a beautiful green world, full of
freedoms and opportunities... You
give us ownership of our lives for
the first time... and you ask no
more of us than you do of
yourselves: to live by the rules...
rules that aren't made to keep one
people subordinate to another, but
rules that exist to preserve
equality. You aspire to very high
ideals here.
Sykes is watching Jetson, mesmerized. The guy's never
said this much at one time before.
If he wasn't drunk, Jetson would never let himself open up
to a human like this.
JETSON
(continuing)
I hope you can understand how
special your world is... how unique
a people you humans are. So it us
all the more painful and confusing
to us that so few of you seem
capable of living up the the ideals
you set for yourselves.
SYKES
Don't count on me, George. I never
had any ideals.
Jetson smiles a little. He knows that's bullshit.
JETSON
We don't understand the hatred, the
contempt. But we must bear it... we
must not react in anger... because
our situation here is still fragile.
The separationists would see us
returned to the quarantine camps.
The fundamentalists say we have no
more human rights than dogs or cats.
But the prejudice we face here is so
insignificant compared to the pain
that we've known before. And that
is why we are so grateful.
Sykes studies him a long time through heavy-lidded eyes.
Finally--
SYKES
Yeah, well... except I did hear you
eat your dead.
Jetson looks at him a long beat, then--
JETSON
(deadpan)
Only on Fridays.
Sykes stares at him for about five seconds and then
explodes with laughter.
SYKES
You son-of-a-bitch. You're okay.
Jetson stands unsteadily, and announces:
JETSON
I'm going home.
SYKES
Yeah, go home. Get some sleep. You
do sleep, don't you?
Jetson, going out the front door, just waves over his
shoulder without turning around. He's gone.
SYKES
What a wildman...
Sykes, stands there wobbling, then he collapses backward
onto the sofa, unconscious. And we MATCH DISSOLVE TO--
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - DAWN
The first hues of dawn stream through the window. Sykes
remains passed out on the sofa where we left him.
EXT. STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN
The slug-mobile parked at the curb. Silence, then the
RUMBLE of a heavy truck... and a tow truck turns onto this
street at the corner.
The tow truck glides to the curb in front of the slug-
mobile. The driver stays inside as his passenger alights
carrying a tool kit and a paper bag. The human is Quint.
Quint uses a slim-jim to open the slug-mobile door, then
slides behind the wheel.
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - DAWN
Quint slides the contents from the paper bag. It is a
packet of C-4 plastic explosives, with a primer cap, and
two lead wires with their ends bared. Quint bends down,
starts to work under the dash. As his head disappears
from FRAME, suddenly another head appears above the
seats... George Jetson sitting up groggily in the back
seat. A blanket slips off his head and shoulders. He
sits there blinking, rubbing his eyes, feeling lousy.
Under the dash, Quint starts to whistle as he works.
Mistake.
Jetson, with a puzzled expression, leans forward and sees
this guy in the front seat. Before he can jump-start his
brain, Quint sits up, sees him, and hammers him in the
face with his fist. Jetson is knocked back, holding his
face. That was the last thing he needed.
EXT. STREET - FRONT OF SYKES' BUILDING - DAWN
Meanwhile Quint is shouting and bailing out of the car.
He runs and leaps into the already moving tow truck.
It is sliding around the corner out of sight just as
Jetson stumbles out of the car. He whips out his gun from
the unfamiliar shoulder rig and it flies out of his hand.
Jetson sags against the side of the car, mumbles an alien
phrase, clearly the equivalent of ""Fuck it..."".
CUT TO:
INT. SYKES' APARTMENT - DAY
Sykes is in the fetal position on the couch where we left
him. Someone is POUNDING on the door. He regains
consciousness reluctantly.
SYKES
This better be good news or money.
He shambles to the door and gets it open, admitting
Jetson. Jetson holds the C-4 charge in a handkerchief
with one hand and gives it to Sykes.
JETSON
Hold this.
(lurching to the
sink)
I feel very terrible.
Sykes registers what he's holding. He moves to Jetson,
who is running his head under the tap.
SYKES
Where'd you get this?!!
JETSON
A man, a human, was wiring it to
your car. I didn't get a good look
at him.
(then, registering
that it's day;
panicked)
I must call my wife...
CUT TO:
INT. PRECINCT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY
Jetson is starting to take on Sykes' looks, his clothing
rumpled and a day old. Sykes has showered and changed so
he's not suffering as much by comparison. They approach
Sykes' desk.
JETSON
She's going to divorce me.
SYKES
George, she's not gonna divorce you.
You mate for life, remember?
JETSON
She's very progressive. I'm certain
she's considering it.
ANGLE - A UNIFORMED SECRETARY
distributing phone slips nearby notices Sykes.
SECRETARY
You guys are looking for somebody
named Strader, right?
SYKES
Yeah.
SECRETARY
Fedorchuk and Alterez just phoned
in. They found him.
(Sykes and Jetson
react)
Or at least what's left of him,
washed up on the beach at Zuma.
Sykes and Jetson react again.
SECRETARY
(continuing; handing
over the message
slip)
They're still there if you wanna
catch them.
She moves off.
SYKES
Well, let's roll, George.
JETSON
(with a stricken
expression)
To the... to the beach?
SYKES
Come on, let's go, dude. Surf's up!
CUT TO:
EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - ZUMA BEACH - DUSK
CRANE SHOT, nice and WIDE, showing the slug-mobile turning
off P.C.H. onto a gravel road which curves down the the
beach. The following is V.O. as the car approaches the
water.
JETSON (V.O.)
Stop the car.
SYKES (V.O.)
Why?
JETSON (V.O.)
Please, I must get out here.
SYKES (V.O.)
Come on, you won't have to get near
the water.
JETSON (V.O.)
Stop the car!
We see the car pull to a stop in a cloud of dust.
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK
SYKES
All right, okay. Keep your
pantyhose on. Jeez, when in doubt,
freak out, for chrissake.
Sykes sees that his partner is covered with a sudden sheen
of sweat, his hands shaking. Sykes softens.
SYKES
(continuing)
It's all right, George. It's cool.
Just wait here, all right? I'll be
back in a coupla minutes.
JETSON
Thank you.
He climbs out and Sykes drives down to the beach... toward
a cluster of vehicles: a Sheriff's black-and-white, a
coroner's wagon, and Fedorchuk's unmarked sedan.
EXT. BEACH - DUSK
A quick glimpse of a pile of dark yuck in the shape of a
person, black and skeletal beneath the remains of a silk
suit. Wound around the corpse are streamers of kelp and
other high tide detritus.
ANGLE ON SYKES, FEDORCHUK, AND ALTEREZ
looking down at the body. A CORONER'S TECHNICIAN is doing
a closer inspection.
FEDORCHUK
Found his wallet in his jacket
pocket. Joshua Strader, big as
life.
CORONER'S TECH
Jesus, what a mess. It's gonna be a
bear to make a positive
determination, but it looks to me
like he was shot before being tossed
in the drink. At least twice--
(indicates where
hearts would've
been on the body)
-- here, and here.
Sykes absorbs this. He rises along with Fedorchuk and
Alterez.
SYKES
How're you two doing on Tuggle's
killer?
ALTEREZ
The store owner's son is in a street
gang, so now we're thinking maybe
it's gang related.
SYKES
Yeah, that's real good. You guys
follow up on that for a coupla
months.
Fedorchuk looks up at Jetson standing on the bluff above.
FEDORCHUK
Look at your dildo partner. He's
too scared to even come down to the
sand.
(calls up to Jetson,
even though he's too
far away to hear)
You're not gonna get wet standing
here, moron!
SYKES
I'd like to see you next to a sea of
hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see
how much surfin' you'd do.
Alterez shoots a polaroid of the body. Sykes grabs it as
it emerges from the camera and walks back toward the car.
Fedorchuk flips him the bird. As Sykes rounds the car, he
sees that someone has drawn on the door in yellow liquid
chalk marker a big star with ""E.T. P.D."" printed inside
it. Sykes looks around. Fedorchuk and the others stand
together chuckling, conspicuously not looking in his
direction.
SYKES
Cute.
EXT. BEACH ROAD - DUSK
Sykes has stopped to pick Jetson up.
He's wiping the ""E.T. P.D."" from the door as Jetson
approaches from the edge of the bluff. Fedorchuk pulls up
alongside in his n.d. sedan. He calls off to Jetson, who
is still twenty yards away.
FEDORCHUK
Well, if it isn't Detective Jetson.
Forget you hip waders, big guy?
SYKES
Lay off, asshole.
FEDORCHUK
I may be an asshole, but at least
I'm a real detective, not some outer
shit space thing.
Sykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be
highly dangerous, saunters to Fedorchuk's car and leans
against it.
SYKES
Yeah? you're a real honest-to-god
detective...?
Sykes grabs the back of Fedorchuk's head and slams it into
the steering wheel, BAM-HONK!, and in doing so, has hurt
his hand again (the hand he hit Jetson with).
He shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing
Fedorchuk's car keys with the other.
SYKES
(continuing)
Then detect these!
Fedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car
keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff. Jetson, just
climbing into the slug-mobile, witnesses the last of this
scene without knowing how it began.
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - DUSK
Sykes gets in, slams the door. His hand hurts as he grabs
the wheel. He holds the wheel gingerly as he slams the
car into gear and hurls gravel up the road toward P.C.H.
Jetson looks over, curious.
JETSON
What was that about?
SYKES
(embarrassed that he
defended Jetson)
Nothing.
On Jetson's confused expression, we--
CUT TO:
EXT. BURGER STAND - NIGHT
A different burger stand. Sykes and Jetson sit across
from each other at one of the outdoor tables... Sykes with
his greasy burger, Jetson with his mole strips. This time
they have no trouble eating in front of each other as they
talk.
SYKES
... So we've got three guys dead.
All Newcomers, all killed the same
way -- execution style.
JETSON
Warren Hubley was in middle
management at a refinery... Joshua
Strader operated a successful bar
and nightclub...
SYKES
... and Porter ran a piece of shit
mom-and-pop mini-mart.
(beat)
So what the hell's the connection?
CUT TO:
INT. PATHOLOGY LAB OFFICE - NIGHT
Sykes and Jetson enter the cluttered lab office. Winter
is here eating take-out chicken at his cluttered desk.
SYKES
You guys finished the postmortem on
Strader yet?
WINTER
(his mouth full)
You mean the Blob? They're
finishing up now.
JETSON
Is Bentner here? I must speak with
him.
WINTER
He went home early -- his kid was
sick.
Jetson frowns.
WINTER
(continuing)
Yeah, but he left something for you.
He wipes his greasy fingers on a napkin, then finds an
envelope on the desk and hands it to Jetson. Jetson tears
open the sealed envelope. The message inside is written
in the alien language.
WINTER
(continuing)
Does this have something to do with
the test he ran that he wouldn't
tell me about?
CLOSE ON - JETSON
His expression grows stricken as he reads the message.
BACK TO SCENE
SYKES
(getting very curious
and suspicious now)
What kind of test?
WINTER
Looking for some foreign compound in
the blood of that alien you dropped
the other day.
SYKES
Did he find anything?
Winter shrugs, indicates the message Jetson reads, as if
to say, ""Maybe it says in there"".
SYKES
(to Jetson)
Well?
Jetson refolds the paper and puts it in his pocket.
He is clearly disturbed by what he has read. He looks at
Sykes a moment, then quickly breaks eye contact.
JETSON
It is nothing.
Jetson quickly moves off. Sykes hurries off after him.
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
Sykes hurries to catch up with the fast walking Jetson.
They eventually reach the elevators and Jetson jabs the
button during:
SYKES
What's this nothing shit? It wasn't
nothing yesterday when you asked
Bentner to run that test and he
looked like he was about to shit
peach pits, and it's not nothing
now. Don't lie to me, George,
you're bad at it.
JETSON
(distant, closed)
You must leave me alone on this.
The elevator arrives, he steps in. Sykes follows.
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
They enter the empty elevator. Jetson presses the button
to descend.
SYKES
No, see, I don't leave you alone...
I'm your partner. I don't work that
way... Tug didn't work that way.
Jetson remains steadfast. Sykes, about to explode, slams
his palm against the red Emergency Stop button and the
elevator lurches to a halt between floors.
SYKES
(continuing)
No secrets, goddammit! You don't
hold back from me. Whatever is
going on, you're gonna tell me now!
JETSON
(agonizing)
No. I cannot involve you. This is
not your concern.
SYKES
The hell it isn't, when somebody
wires up enough C-4 explosive to my
car to turn me into pink mist!
(beat)
That Slag was on something, and not
sour milk, either? Am I right?
(he has backed Jetson
to the wall by sheer
force of will)
TELL ME! What is it?
JETSON
(finally)
... It is called ss'jabroka'. To us
it is a potent narcotic.
SYKES
How potent?
JETSON
Like your cocaine, I suppose. The
""high"" lasts several hours. We
would receive small amounts of it...
as a reward for our labor.
SYKES
We? You've taken it?
JETSON
We all did.
SYKES
Where did he get it? Was there any
of it on the ship?
JETSON
No... I am sure not. That is why I
am so concerned... someone must now
be producing it here.
(emphatically)
But none of my people know how to
make it. The process was carefully
guarded.
SYKES
(as the enormity
sinks in)
Jesus, this is major.
(then)
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
Why'd you hold out on me?
JETSON
Your people don't know about this
part of out past. And they can't
know -- It would threaten our entire
existence here.
The voltage runs out of Sykes. He seems to understand
Jetson's dilemma.
SYKES
George... look me in the eye...
George, you don't ever lie to me
again.
JETSON
I must trust you, Matthew. I cannot
stop this without you.
Sykes stare at Jetson... absorbing the enormity of the
earth-shattering secret this alien has asked him to keep.
CUT TO:
EXT. COUNTY MORGUE - NIGHT
Sykes and Jetson move quickly to the slug-mobile. Sykes
reaches for the driver's door handle with his punching
hand. He winces in pain... the son-of-a-bitch still
hurts. He looks across at Jetson opening the passenger
door.
SYKES
George? How about you drive...
Jetson looks over at him... gently reacting to this vote
of confidence. They walk quickly around to the opposite
doors, climb in.
INT. CORRIDOR - BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT
Sykes and Jetson move down this government-building
corridor.
SYKES
There's gotta be some other
connection.
They enter a door marked BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS.
INT. BUREAU OF NEWCOMER AFFAIRS - NIGHT
HIGH SHOT showing the maze of partitioned cubicles filling
this huge room. It's all but deserted. Sykes and Jetson
are off to one side with a heavyset woman (human) COMPUTER
OPERATOR, who they're shanghaied into helping them after
hours.
CLOSER - AT COMPUTER OPERATOR'S DESK
She sits at her computer terminal. Sykes and Jetson stand
behind her as she types in commands and information.
She types: Hubley, Warren. The computer screen flashes
past various information, then settles on a screen full of
information of HUBLEY, WARREN.
OPERATOR
Here's Hubley.
(scanning it)
Left Quarantine on November
thirtieth, relocated first to
Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles
early in February the following
year. Field of expertise: chemical
manufacturing. Looks like he passed
up several other better paying jobs
waiting for that one at the
refinery.
SYKES
Try Joshua Strader, will ya,
darlin'?
OPERATOR
For you, anything.
The Operator punches up STRADER, JOSHUA. The screen fills
with information.
OPERATOR
(continuing, reading
from screen)
Released on November twenty-ninth.
Came immediately to L.A. Ten weeks
after arriving he took over the
abandoned club which is now
Encounters.
JETSON
(to Operator)
Now the store owner, please. Cecil
Porter.
She types it in.
OPERATOR
Released December one. He and his
wife moved first to Modesto, then
Coalinga, California -- wherever
that is -- settled in L.A. in
April. Field of expertise:
organic chemical engineering. He
and his wife have one child, a son.
SYKES
Yeah -- we met him. Wonderful
boy... close personal friend of
George's here.
OPERATOR
I'm sorry, Matt. Nothing here seems
to be matching up...
But Sykes wasn't listening. He's starting off... an idea
forming. He stands there a moment, considering it, his
face looking like he's chewing something sour. It's so
off-the-wall it takes a moment for him to assimilate it.
Then--
SYKES
Holy shit...
(to Jetson)
Look what we're staring at: three
Newcomers with nothing in common,
right? What if it's just one other
guy who killed these three?
(Jetson looks at him
blankly)
Three and one make four. Four
Newcomers... of totally different
backgrounds...
(Jetson still doesn't
get it)
You and the store owner's son --
that punker!
Suddenly the realization hits Jetson, too. He looks at
Sykes.
JETSON
... Quarantine.
Sykes spins to the Operator, excited.
SYKES
Can you dig up their Quarantine
records in this thing?
OPERATOR
Sure. Just a minute.
She moves up a screen to the top of Porter's information.
OPERATOR
(to herself)
Porter was in Lodge seven seven two.
She rapidly types in additional information. The screen
shifts as she jumps files. Finally she gets a line that
reads: ENTER LODGE NUMBER: She types: 7-7-2.
Sykes and Jetson lean in as the screen goes blank... then
information flashes past as the computer searches... then,
finally: Occupants, Quarantine Lodge 772: HUBLEY,
WARREN......... STRADER, JOSHUA.........
Sykes and Jetson react -- their hunch is coming true.
On the computer screen: .........PORTER, CECIL.........
Sykes and Jetson, their faces bathed in the green kick of
the screen, stare without blinking, waiting for that forth
name.
On the computer screen: .........HARCOURT, WILLIAM.
CLOSE ON - SYKES AND JETSON
reacting to the name.
CUT TO:
EXT. ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
CLOSE on a limousine door as it opens and a tall figure
rises from the back seat. We TILT UP to reveal William
Harcourt.
We MOVE with him as he walks to the n.d. van (from the
beach scene) parked in front of the limousine. Kipling is
just sliding out of the passenger side of the cab. Quint
exits the driver door. Kipling slides open the van's side
panel, reaches in for--
-- a large black suitcase. He slides it out. Harcourt
nods. He and Kipling start into the club, followed by
Quint.
INT. ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
The club is deserted tonight as Harcourt and entourage
move toward the back.
EXT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Harcourt and the others move up the stairs to the second
floor. Cassandra, wearing a slinky dress, is at the top
of the stairs waiting for them. She's very uncomfortable
dealing with Harcourt. Kipling and Quint continue on
toward the office door. Harcourt pauses with Cassandra.
He touches her neckline of her dress, letting his fingers
linger against her flesh.
HARCOURT
Quite lovely...
(best)
What is your name again?
CASSANDRA
(flinching
involuntarily at
his touch)
Cassandra.
HARCOURT
(a chilling smile)
I will have to remember that...
He continues down toward the office door. Cassandra
watches him go.
CUT TO:
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - MOVING - NIGHT
JETSON
They had months in quarantine to
develop the plan. Porter, with his
chemistry background, must have
somehow come up with the formula for
the drug. Hubley manufactured it --
at the refinery. Strader, through
the nightclub, established a
distribution network. And
Harcourt--
SYKES
Harcourt was the brain who brought
it all together.
EXT. REFINERY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT
EXT. REFINERY - NIGHT
The slug-mobile skids to a stop at the loading dock
entrance. Sykes and Jetson climb out. They hop up onto
the loading platform and move purposefully into the well-
lit interior through the open door.
INT. REFINERY - NIGHT
It is Saturday night, the plant is barely operational --
only a few WORKERS around. Sykes and Jetson move
purposefully toward the back.
SYKES
Okay, George -- we gotta play this
real smart.
JETSON
If the drug is here, we must destroy
it.
SYKES
No, George -- you're missing the
point. The drug is evidence. We
need to have the evidence, ya know?
Jetson doesn't reply -- he's focused beyond what Sykes is
saying. Sykes spots O'Neal up ahead by the refrigeration
door to the METHANE SECTION.
SYKES
(continuing)
That's the guy...
O'Neal recognizes Sykes and doesn't wait around for the
big Newcomer bearing down on him. He dodges quickly
through the refrigeration door and swings it closed.
Jetson's hand hits the door an instant later, before it is
latched, and he pushes it open despite O'Neal's body
weight against the other side.
INT. METHANE ROOM - NIGHT
Jetson grabs O'Neal by the collar and drags him deeper
into the deserted room.
O'NEAL
Hey, what are you, crazy?! You
can't come in here like this! Hey!
Sykes reaches the doorway, stops and stares.
SYKES
So much for playing it smart...
O'Neal's feet are barely touching the ground as Jetson
moves along the row of drug-manufacturing equipment.
Finally he reaches a stainless steel tub... he runs a long
finger along the inside, comes up with some residue of the
drug. It glistens blue on his finger. It holds him
mesmerized for several moments... his expression that of a
former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so.
SYKES
(tentatively
stepping closer)
Is that it...?
A beat, than Jetson explodes -- he sweeps a rack of
equipment off the worktable, savagely wipes the drug from
his hand onto O'Neal's shirt-front as he slams and pins
the bug-eyed O'Neal to the wall.
SYKES
Uh, George...
JETSON
(in O'Neal's face)
Where is the drug? Where have they
taken it?
O'NEAL
(choking)
What drug? This is an oil refinery,
you...
JETSON
(pushing harder)
WHERE?!
O'NEAL
(unable to breathe)
You... can't do... this!
SYKES
George, uh... you're gonna break his
little chest bones...
JETSON
Stay out of this, Matthew.
(to O'Neal)
Tell me where the drug has been
taken or I will crush your lungs
against this wall.
O'Neal is experiencing real fear now. Sykes has decided
to back Jetson up, for better or worse. He takes the
""good cop"" role.
SYKES
Don't piss him off, O'Neal. When he
gets like this, I can't control him.
I've seen this before. He got like
this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's
spine out and show it to him.
Nothing I could do. I hadda go
throw up.
O'NEAL
(at length, with
great effort)
... They took the stuff out, all of
it -- this afternoon.
JETSON
How much?
O'NEAL
About fifty kilos... of
concentrate... and some street
grade... in tubes.
Jetson reacts to this... then increases the pressure.
O'Neal is really in bad trouble now. Even Sykes takes a
half-step forward -- thinking Jetson might actually crush
this man.
JETSON
Where have they taken it?
O'NEAL
Encount... Encounters Club.
Finally, Jetson eases off. O'Neal slumps to the floor,
gasping for air.
CUT TO:
EXT. REFINERY - NIGHT
This time Jetson is the Juggernaut... his expression set
and hard... as he strides to the car. Sykes practically
has to run to keep up.
SYKES
George, c'mon -- lighten up. It's
a beauty of a case. Don't sweat it
-- we got him by the short hairs.
He ain't gonna make any more of the
shit.
JETSON
The fifty kilos, Matthew. I have to
find it. I can't let it get out on
the street.
SYKES
Why? What's the big goddamn deal?
Jetson has reached the driver's door of the slug-mobile,
yanks it open.
SYKES
(continuing; as
Jetson starts the
car
You destroy that drug, you destroy
the case. Don't blow the whole
thing now by not following
procedure.
JETSON
(through the open
driver's window)
Fuck procedure.
And to Sykes' shock, he throws the car in gear and peels
out.
SYKES
Hey!!
Jetson accelerates toward the security gate. The guard in
the shack starts yelling and runs out as the slug-mobile
bashes through the barricade bar.
SYKES
GEORGE! GODDAMMIT!!
Sykes stands there like a moron -- with no partner, no
car. A pickup truck carrying a Worker just getting off
his shift starts ambling past. Sykes runs in front of it,
waving his badge. The pickup skids to a stop.
SYKES
Police. Get out. I need this
thing. Out, now!
The poor guy bails out and Sykes jumps in, jamming it into
gear. The truck has seen better days... it doesn't have
much power to give as Sykes floors it toward the exit.
CUT TO:
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
As Jetson races along the freeway, whipping past other
traffic. He takes a hand off the wheel, reaches over and
pops open the glovebox. He shoves some maps and garbage
aside, reaches deeper inside for something -- we don't see
what.
CUT TO:
INT. ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
Cassandra walks a trio of well-dressed DRUG DEALERS (two
alien, one human) through the deserted club.
INT. SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT
She leads them to the office door, opens it, then lets
them enter ahead of her. A couple of them smile at her
lasciviously as they brush past. She is about to enter
herself when an alien hand flashes in behind her, covering
her mouth, pulling her backward away from the door.
It is Jetson. He had been hiding behind some crates
stacked here in the corridor. He pins Cassandra
powerfully to the wall, keeping one hand over her mouth.
She struggles until she sees who it is.
JETSON
I am here to take Harcourt. Where
is he?
She hesitates, then decides to cooperate, indicates with a
nod toward the office door.
CASSANDRA
In there.
JETSON
(pulling his gun)
Show me.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
The large suitcase rests on the expansive conference
table. A manicured alien hand reaches in and slowly opens
it. Inside are fifty one-kilo glass tubes full of the
viscous blue drug. Also several of the small, individual
dispensers. It is Harcourt, standing behind the table in
a pool of light, who has opened the suitcase. He is
flanked by Kipling... with Quint elsewhere in the room.
The room is lit by track light, creating pools of light
and dark.
The two alien Dealers' eyes widen at the sight of the
drug. The human dealer doesn't know what it is.
HARCOURT
(to alien dealers)
It's been a long time, hasn't it,
gentlemen?
HUMAN DEALER
What is it?
HARCOURT
A sweet indulgence from out past...
resurrected for our future.
Harcourt sees the hungering expressions on the alien
Dealers' faces... smiles knowingly. He slides one of the
dispensers from the suitcase.
HARCOURT
(continuing; to
alien dealers)
Please feel free to sample the
quality. The experience will be
everything you remember it to be...
One of the alien Dealers takes the dispenser, brings it to
his tongue. The other alien dealer turns to Harcourt--
ALIEN DEALER
Where'd you get it?
HARCOURT
I arranged to spend some time with
three very resourceful men. With a
certain amount of coaxing, one of
them was able to reconstitute the
formula for me.
(beat)
They worked very well together.
Unfortunately, they are no longer
with us... but I was fortunate
enough to reap the benefit of their
endeavor.
He indicates the drug. The first alien Dealer sways
gently, enjoying the sensation. The second alien Dealer
takes his hit... shudders as the first rush washes over
him. The human Dealer is no fool... he grabs the
dispenser.
HUMAN DEALER
Let me try some.
(he does,
immediately spits
it out)
Jesus! Tastes like detergent!
HARCOURT
And that's all the effect it will
have on you. But when my fellow
Newcomers learn they can obtain it
here, they will work very hard... to
make as much money as they can... to
give it to me.
Suddenly, a voice from the shadows near the open door to
the other office:
VOICE
You haven't told him all of it.
Harcourt and the others react. Quint leaps to his feet,
caught off guard. Kipling reaches for his shoulder
holster. A silhouette beside the open door to the outer
office nudges Cassandra into the light of the room, then
steps out himself. It is Jetson.
Quint gets his gun out, is about to aim... when his eyes
go wide at the sight of something Jetson holds.
It is the plastic explosive charge that Quint was wiring
to the slug-mobile. The wires are connected and Jetson's
finger squeezes down hard on the detonation push-switch.
QUINT
He's got the C-4 charge!
Jetson moves forward slowly, holding the bomb in front of
him. He is sweating rivers. The others quickly join him.
He nudges Cassandra ahead of himself, keeping her where he
can see her.
QUINT
(continuing)
Just take it real casual, buddy.
Keep your finger on that button and
don't do nothing squirrely.
HARCOURT
If you release that button, you not
only kill us, but yourself.
JETSON
To get you and that--
(indicates drug in
suitcase)
-- I would do it.
He says it with such straightforward eye contact, that
Harcourt (and we) know he isn't bluffing.
JETSON
Everyone up against that wall.
Very slowly.
(to Harcourt)
Except you.
Harcourt remains behind the desk. Cassandra stays where
she is, near Jetson. The others move to the wall.
Kipling in particular is going nuts, letting this happen.
Jetson takes the ""sample"" dispenser from the table, tosses
it into the suitcase, then closes the lid and locks it.
All the while keeping his eye on Harcourt and the others.
HARCOURT
One small matter seems to have
escaped your attention. That--
(indicates suitcase)
-- is not on any books as a
controlled substance. Legally it
might as well be fifty kilos of...
grape jelly.
JETSON
The charge is murder... and
conspiracy to commit murder.
Hubley, Porter, Strader... probably
others.
There's a flicker of concern behind Harcourt's icy blue
eyes.
Cassandra stares at Harcourt.
CASSANDRA
You... you killed Strader?
Cassandra runs to Harcourt grabbing his jacket.
CASSANDRA
Where's Todd?! Did you do something
to Todd?!
Harcourt looks down at her, totally uninvolved.
HARCOURT
Todd? Who is Todd.
(then remembers;
smiles)
Ah, poor Mr. Watson.
Cassandra's eyes go wide as the horror of what he said
sinks in. Jetson nudges Harcourt with the suitcase. They
start out. Cassandra, wild with rage, grabs Quint's .357
and with a KEENING WAIL, brings it up toward Harcourt's
face.
JETSON
NOOO!
Jetson drops the suitcase as he lunges for the gun. He
manages to knock it away just as she fires -- the bullet
going into the wall behind Harcourt. Striking like a
mongoose, Kipling leaps forward, grabbing the two lead
wires on the bomb in Jetson's hand and jerking them apart.
Jetson reacts an instant late... releasing the switch...
and nothing happens.
KIPLING
I got it!
Kipling tackles Jetson and they both go crashing to the
floor. Quint grabs the gun from Cassandra and hammers her
with it, hard. She drops to her knees and Quint viciously
hits her again.
Meanwhile, Jetson struggles to regain his feet. Kipling
rears back and delivers a crushing blow under Jetson's arm
-- to the nerve plexus. Jetson instantly folds over
forward and Kipling savagely brings up his knee into
Jetson's face, flipping him back. Kipling slams him into
the wall face-first, pinning him there.
HARCOURT
Kill them both.
KIPLING
Here?
HARCOURT
(raging)
Do it!
Quint brings the gun up, places the muzzle against the
base of Cassandra's skull, starts to squeeze the trigger.
There's a loud BLAM! and Cassandra flinches... then looks
up.
Quint is blown backward away from her.
Sykes stand in the doorway from the private office, the
Casull smoking in his hand.
Quint hits the wall behind him -- only it's not a solid
wall, but the huge window overlooking the club. He
crashes through it.
ANGLE FROM DANCE FLOOR
as the wall of mirror explodes IN SLOW MOTION and Quint
cartwheels to the floor in a shower of diamonds.
ANGLE - IN THE OFFICE
Kipling shoves Jetson aside, draws his gun and fires at
Sykes.
Sykes dodges into the private office for cover.
The three Dealers dive behind any available furniture.
Harcourt snatches up the suitcase and rushes to the door
leading into the adjoining outer office.
Sykes swings around the edge of the private office door,
straight-arms the Casull into the office and fires.
Kipling fires back, crossing toward the outer office door,
covering Harcourt's back. Sykes ducks back down.
An unsteady Jetson rises from the floor, sees Harcourt and
Kipling escaping, and takes off after them.
Sykes straight-arms the gun into the room again... sees
Jetson disappearing through the adjoining office door. He
moves into the room as the three drug Dealers, arms up in
surrender, rise from behind the furniture.
ALIEN DEALER
Don't shoot, man -- we're unarmed --
look!
Sykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra.
SYKES
You okay?
CASSANDRA
(dazed, but all
right)
Yeah...
And he charges out the adjoining office door.
EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT
Harcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs. Jetson
is ten feet above them. Sykes flies out onto the fire
escape, a few steps behind Jetson. A POLICE CAR SIREN is
HEARD arriving O.S.
EXT. ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT
Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into
the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running.
Two seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the
fire escape, find themselves near the unit.
HARCOURT
Here!
He throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps
in. Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear
and floors it.
Jetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels
out. Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing
car. One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the
rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going.
JETSON
This way!
He indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby. They race to
it, jump in... Sykes driving. He burns rubber as he pulls
out.
A second arriving police unit pulls into the alley,
heading straight for the slug-mobile. Sykes has to grate
between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get
past.
EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
Harcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come
thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic.
The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them.
INSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE
Harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches...
eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and
SIREN blast on.
EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
It looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing
the howling police car through traffic.
Jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it
out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy.
JETSON
Slow traffic on your right... you're
clear at the left rear...
(Sykes changes lanes)
Careful, red light ahead...
With Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the
cross-traffic without incident.
EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
The traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response
to the approaching lights and SIREN. Kipling dodges
around the stopped traffic easily.
The same traffic that has pulled over for the police car
now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the
slug-mobile.
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
Sykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same
juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley.
JETSON
Yellow light ahead turning red...
But Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it.
JETSON
(continuing; wide-
eyed)
Red light! Red light!
EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
Sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the
intersection, and continues the chase. On the wrong side
of the road, head-on into traffic.
Headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along
the wrong side. They eventually catch up to the police
unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between
them.
Sykes keeps one hand on the wheel and draws the Casull
with the other. He brings it up and around right in front
of Jetson's nose, pointing it through the passenger window
at Kipling.
At that moment, Kipling glances over and reacts to the
bore of this huge gun staring him in the kisser.
Jetson reacts to the gun in his face... then reacts to
something else he sees beyond it.
JETSON
Green light, Matthew.
(Sykes doesn't
respond)
Green light!
Now Sykes looks. The light at the intersection has just
turned green -- and the rows of the cars that were waiting
start coming. It's a wall of headlights coming right for
the slug-mobile.
SYKES
Shit!
JETSON
Ss-ai!
EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT
Sykes locks up the brakes. Kipling veers around a couple
of cars and speeds away.
Because of the other traffic, Sykes has only one course of
action. He skids a left onto a side street.
EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
Sykes burns rubber down this quieter street, squeals a
right onto another street that parallels the street the
police unit is on. At the first street available, he cuts
back in behind the police unit.
EXT. FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT
Sykes' car tears along below the overpass -- with the
police unit directly above them! An on-ramp approaches
for the slug-mobile and Sykes floors it.
INT. BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT
Harcourt turns in his seat just in time to see the slug-
mobile airborne as it flies from the on-ramp, landing a
few feet behind the black-and-white's bumper.
EXT. FIRST STREET OVERPASS - NIGHT
With the slug-mobile now, the police unit hangs a right,
cuts through a parking lot, and bounces onto--
EXT. SECOND STREET AND TUNNEL - NIGHT
The police unit hangs a u-turn into the Second Street
tunnel. It clips one of the civilian cars, causing a
pile-up of traffic behind the police unit.
The slug-mobile skids to a stop, blocked by the clog of
traffic in the tunnel. Sykes is out of the drivers door
in a flash, stand on the door frame, and yells--
SYKES
Move your goddamned cars!
People climb out of their cars dazed and bewildered --
ignoring Sykes. Sykes slides behind the wheel, bangs his
bumper into the car in front of him, and pushes the car
far enough forward to get around. He speeds off.
INT./ EXT. BLACK-AND-WHITE - FREEWAY - NIGHT
Kipling rockets up a freeway on-ramp. Harcourt smiles
with satisfaction -- there's no sign of the slug-mobile
behind them. Kipling eases off, blends into the flow of
traffic.
EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT
Sykes slaloms the slug-mobile through the civilian
traffic like Mario Andretti lapping the pack at
Indianapolis.
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
Jetson spots the police unit in the right hand lane ahead.
JETSON
There!
Sykes sees it. Thinking fast, he eases off, using another
car as a blind. He waits until the police unit is
parallel to an off-ramp, then guns ahead and swings right,
directly for the police unit.
Kipling looks over, reacts, just as the slug-mobile
broadsides the police unit. Sykes forces the police unit
up the off-ramp.
EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT
Door handle to door handle, the two cars slue to the
right. The police unit breaks out in front, but Sykes
stays right on its ass. They charge up onto--
EXT. VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT
The police unit and slug-mobile -- bumper to bumper at 80
MPH.
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
As the cars scream along, Jetson cranes out the side
window, looking in distress at the inky seawater flashing
past below.
EXT. VINCENT THOMAS BRIDGE - NIGHT
They reach the far end of the bridge and skid wide onto--
EXT. HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
A clear two lane straightaway near the ocean. Sykes
pushes the slug-mobile to its limits, pulls alongside the
police unit. The two cars trade blows at 90+ MPH.
Kipling manages to send Sykes onto the dirt shoulder,
slowing him down.
INT. BLACK-AND-WHITE - NIGHT
Kipling watches the slug-mobile in the rearview mirror,
then looks back out the front to see the end of the road
coming up fast! Harcourt bellows to Kipling, who slams on
the brakes.
EXT. END OF BOULEVARD - NIGHT
The police unit skids to a stop before hitting a chain
link fence where the road ends. An abandoned drawbridge
and the ocean are on the other side of the fence.
With nowhere else to go, Harcourt yells something at
Kipling and Kipling floors it back the way they came.
EXT. HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
The two cars are racing for a full head-on. At the last
instant, Sykes wrenches the wheel, throws the slug-mobile
sideways, passenger side first. The police unit smashes
into the rear door and fender of the slug-mobile, both
cars skidding madly to a stop. A fire ignites under the
hood of the police unit.
INT. SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT
Sykes sits stunned behind the wheel. Disoriented but
conscious, he raises his head, looks over... sees Jetson
out cold, his forehead gashed and bleeding. Then he looks
over and sees the fire growing under the police unit's
hood which is crunched up against the rear of the slug-
mobile -- near the gas tank.
EXT. HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
Sykes slides out of the driver's door, stumbles to
Jetson's door, wrenches it open, and drags the huge
unconscious alien away from the cars.
He's still dragging Jetson away when he spots Harcourt
pulling himself through the smashed police unit window.
Bruised and bleeding, Harcourt reaches in for the
suitcase, then starts to run with it.
With Jetson a safe distance away from the cars, Sykes
clambers to his feet, draws the Casull, and starts off
after Harcourt.
Harcourt reaches the chain link fence leading to the
closed drawbridge. He heaves the suitcase over, then
starts to climb.
Sykes lumbers past the burning police unit. Kipling is
still behind the wheel, his head slumped forward. Sykes
is just past the cars when they explode -- sending hoods
and door panels and glass flying in all directions.
Harcourt, on the other side of the fence, grabs the
suitcase and limps off into the shadowy world of the
abandoned drawbridge.
Sykes reaches the fence. Instead of climbing, he simply
blows the lock to hell with the Casull, and kicks open the
gate.
EXT. ABANDONED DRAWBRIDGE - NIGHT
The end of the bridge is in the ""up"" position... a huge
asphalt slab stabbing up into the night sky. Harcourt
runs along the pools of light and dark at the edge of the
bridge, the black seawater drifting past beside him. His
foot slips once and he almost goes over the side.
Sykes -- backlit by the burning cars, the big Casull a
prominent part of the silhouette -- just keeps coming.
Harcourt reaches the shadows at the end of the bridge --
and has nowhere to go. He is backed into a corner, with
seawater on two side of him. Harcourt pivots frantically,
sees Sykes coming this way. Harcourt is a trapped animal.
His chest heaves in panic. Then his gaze falls on the
suitcase behind him... and slowly... finally... a look of
resolve comes into his eye.
ON SYKES
He eases cautiously toward the shadows where he knows
Harcourt is. There's some movement among the shadows, and
Sykes straight-arms the Casull, his finger white against
the trigger.
Perspiration drips into Sykes' eye, but he doesn't blink.
A long moment then--
ANGLE - THE SHADOWS
Harcourt emerges from the darkness. His face is composed,
the superior glint is back in his eye. His arms are held
away from his sides at 30 degree angles, clearly in
surrender.
Sykes cat-steps forward slowly. Harcourt stares at Sykes'
eyes, and the desire there that Harcourt will give him an
excuse. Harcourt simply... smiles.
SYKES
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're
history...
HARCOURT
No, Sergeant -- not history...
(beat)
Eternity...
And now Sykes sees it -- Harcourt has been holding one of
the one-kilo glass cylinders of the drug concealed behind
his arm. He brings it up over his head, grins at Sykes,
then tilts back his head and cracks the cylinder open.
The blue gel pours into his mouth and down his chin. His
mouth fills.
He looks back at Sykes, making eye contact... his eyes
mad, defiant. And -- he swallows. Long hold -- then the
wallop of the overdose hits him... his face contorts in
agony as he begins to convulse. Sykes, wide-eyed, lowers
the Casull and watches as Harcourt drops to the ground and
goes into a massive violent seizure. His limbs hammer
against the deck... his back arches fiercely. It is a
brutal, agonizing ten seconds. Then, finally, his body
becomes still.
Sykes, stunned at what he's just witnessed slowly goes to
him and takes his pulse the way he saw Jetson do it.
HIGH ANGLE SHOT - THE ENTIRE AREA
Sykes stands. He notices the suitcase nearby, latches it,
and hefts it. He carries it with him back toward the
inferno of the wrecked cars, the Casull hanging heavy and
cold in his hand.
ANGLE FOLLOWING SYKES
He approaches the burning cars, heading for Jetson. As he
passes the burning cars, we have a half-second to register
that the driver's door of the police unit is now open
before--
-- a dark figure hurtles at Sykes' back from O.S.! Sykes
is thrown forward. The suitcase crashes to the ground,
and the Casull goes skittering off. Sykes looks up -- to
be met by the singed and bleeding nightmare visage of
Kipling! Kipling reaches down for the suitcase then Sykes
hears it -- the telltale CLINKING SOUND. He looks -- and
sees the exotic silver bracelet on Kipling's wrist. It
connects for him; this is the bandana alien -- the one who
killed Bill Tuggle!
Kipling brings the suitcase above his head. He is a half-
second from hurling it down on Sykes' skull when -- a GUN
ROARS. Kipling is thrown back by the chest wound. Sykes
looks.
ANGLE
Jetson, half sitting up, holds the smoking Casull.
Kipling recovers enough to come at Sykes again with the
suitcase again. Jetson, shaking but determined, fires
again, and again, and again.
Kipling is driven backward by the fusillade, the suitcase
still over his head... until he is blasted at last and
forever, suitcase and all, into the molten core of the
inferno.
Sykes rises, makes his way to Jetson's side. Jetson has
let the weight of the gun carry his hand to the ground.
Sykes kneels beside him, gently taking the gun from the
alien's hand. The two partners remain like this, bathed
in the orange flickering glow of the fire.
HIGH WIDE SHOT
of the drawbridge, the debris, the carnage, and our two
cops...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. HENRY FORD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
The police mop-up is winding down. Cop cars, coroner's
wagons, fire trucks. We MOVE through it all to find Sykes
and Jetson seated on the curb, away from the railing.
JETSON
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I
assume you will be requesting
reassignment now.
SYKES
(cool)
It'd be for your own good. I think
you'd be better off with a partner
who's a little more... by the book.
(smiles)
... Still, I gotta tell you, George,
for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on
wheels once you get going. I'd
kinda hate to miss your next two
days as a detective.
Jetson smiles. He glances up as they are bathed in red
and blue light. A patrol car has pulled up next to them.
Inside is Wiltey, a uniformed cop.
WILTEY
I'll give you guys a lift to the
station. They're waiting to take
your statements on the shootings.
SYKES
(to Jetson)
Let's go, partner.
(then casually
correcting Wiltey
as he rises)
And it's shooting. Singular.
WILTEY
They said two.
SYKES
Nope. I didn't shoot Harcourt... he
o.d.'d.
SHOCK CUT - JETSON
We rapidly PUSH IN ON HIM as his head snaps around toward
Sykes. His expression tells us his blood has just turned
to ice.
CUT TO:
INT. CORONER'S WAGON - NIGHT
ANGLE FORWARD, shooting from the rear of the wagon, toward
the DRIVER and ATTENDANT up front.
DRIVER
So it's just me and her left in the
hot tub, right?
ATTENDANT
You and the blonde?
DRIVER
No, man, the redhead. The blonde's
gone in the house with some other
guy. But a few minutes later she
comes back out, alone, when me and
the redhead are going at it fast and
furious in the tub, ya know... and
she sees us, and... she climbs right
in with us...
ATTENDANT
You're full of shit!
DRIVER
I swear it! If I'm lyin', I'm
dyin'...
And, without warning, A LARGE INHUMAN HAND FLIES UP IN
F.G., having ripped through the sealed body bag just below
FRAME.
CUT TO:
INT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT
Jetson is up front with Wiltey; Sykes sits in the back,
though he is on the edge of the seat, leaning forward
toward the front. Jetson is intently, nervously scanning
ahead and to both sides.
JETSON
You are certain this is the route
they would have taken?
WILTEY
I'm not positive -- but probably.
SYKES
(warily)
What's this about, George? I know
that look.
JETSON
(spots something out
a side window)
There! Go back. Down that side
street.
Wiltey brakes, backs up, then turns into the side street.
ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD
as they approach an eerie scene. The coroner's wagon is
stopped at an angle in the middle of the intersection,
headlights and roof lights cutting into the night, the
back doors wide open. A patrol car is also here, on the
other side of the wagon. There is no movement anywhere
near the two vehicles.
Wiltey pulls the car up, his eyes like saucers at the
eerie scene. He reaches for the radio hand mike. Jetson
quickly covers it with a large hand.
JETSON
No!
(both Sykes and
Wiltey look at him)
We must do this alone.
SYKES
Do what?! George-- ?!
Jetson is already sliding out of the car.
EXT. STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT
Jetson, Sykes, and Wiltey move warily forward, their guns
drawn. They reach the van and Sykes takes Wiltey's
flashlight, shines it through the open back doors. The
doors are bent outward, smashed half off their hinges.
One of the body bags is ripped open, literally split from
end to end. The blue and red lightbar on the other patrol
car can be seen through the wagon's front windshield.
Jetson starts around the wagon toward the patrol car,
Sykes and Wiltey follow. Lights all ablaze, it too is
abandoned. One door has been wrenched off its hinges and
lays in the street, and the front windshield is smashed.
Our three cops approach the car, then Wiltey spots
something beyond the unit.
WILTEY
Oh, God...
Sykes and Jetson look.
The bodies of the coroner wagon Driver and Attendant, as
well as the two OFFICERS from the patrol car, are crushed
and beaten and stretched out on the asphalt. Their arms
are twisted as though by a mad force -- each pointing down
the street toward the dock warehouses ahead. Wiltey
stumbles away, backward.
WILTEY
I'm calling for back up, now.
JETSON
Wiltey, no.
But Wiltey is going. Jetson starts after him... but Sykes
grabs his arm, hard, and spins him.
SYKES
What is this?!
JETSON
(low)
... It's Harcourt.
SYKES
Harcourt is dead.
JETSON
No he's not. Not if he overdosed on
the drug.
(searches for the
words)
Massive amounts trigger a... a
change. Your body functions seize
up, you appear to be dead, but it's
really a state of incubation. When
you emerge you're...
SYKES
(looks at the four
bodies sprawled
before him)
Tell me about it...
CUT TO:
EXT. STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT
One minute later. OPEN CLOSE on a light shining into
CAMERA, then WIDEN to reveal it is one of the door-mounted
spotlights on Wiltey's patrol car. Wiltey eases the car
down the center of the street. Sykes and Jetson, guns
ready, walk slowly along on either side of the car... eyes
everywhere.
MOVING POV
as they move past the shadowy dock warehouses... watching
for any signs of movement.
BACK TO SCENE
Sykes and Jetson converse across the hood of the car as
they walk. Their eyes everywhere.
SYKES
I never thought I'd say this, but --
for once in my life I think I'm
willing to wait for back-up.
JETSON
We can't let him get away.
SYKES
Why the hell are you so dead set
against back-up?
JETSON
(a difficult
admission)
Because... because of what will
happen if humans see what we are
capable of becoming.
SYKES
But there's no more drug.
JETSON
You understand that. But how many
others will?
Sykes looks across at Jetson's troubled expression.
Just then, Wiltey spots a flit of movement cutting across
his headlight beams fifty yards ahead. Whatever it was,
was large and fast. It darted into an open warehouse
door.
WILTEY
There he is!
And Wiltey floors it. Sykes and Jetson watch, unable to
stop him.
JETSON
Wiltey!
He and Sykes take off running. Wiltey skids to the left,
rockets in through the open warehouse door, out of sight.
Sykes and Jetson pour it on. They hear a SCREECH OF
BRAKES. They reach the warehouse door and race through.
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
LOW ANGLE, SHOOTING ACROSS the underside of Wiltey's
stopped patrol car as Sykes' and Jetson's feet appear
around the corner of the warehouse door. The car is still
running -- the exhaust pipe still RUMBLING and expelling
fumes. The feet slow... then cautiously start around the
car. We PAN with them as they move around the side of the
car. A dark liquid begins dripping in EXTREME F.G. We
MOVE UP, to a CLOSE UP of the car bumper. The dark liquid
is blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome. We MOVE
UP farther, and--
-- there is Wiltey's severed head. IN CLOSE UP, resting
on the hood of the patrol car.
Sykes and Jetson stop dead at the sight. Wiltey's body
lies in a heap on the floor near the car. They both
stare, then Sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the
warehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have
done this so fast?
THEIR POV
There are two paths to go. Both dark and scary as hell.
The sound of a distant FOG HORN blends with the CREAKS and
DRIPS of this waterfront building.
ANGLE - SYKES AND JETSON
Jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun
from the dash mount. He checks the chamber as Sykes
checks the Casull.
They exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they
split up. Sykes takes the path to the left, Jetson to the
right.
WITH JETSON
As he moves into a dark area. He slowly picks his way
along a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled
debris, heading toward us. We PAN slightly to the left to
HOLD a door in CLOSE UP. The door, already ajar, eases
open slightly wider. Jetson hears this. He reaches the
door, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all
the way. There's nothing inside... now.
Jetson looks up, sees movement in the distance. It is
Sykes, quite far away, in another section of the
warehouse. Sykes leaves Jetson's field of view.
INT. WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT
Sykes walks around a corner -- freezes, and cocks his head
as he hears VOICES -- followed, curiously, by LAUGHTER.
He eases forward, peers around a bend, and sees -- a table
and a chair. On the table is a mini-television, tuned to
some local late night talk show. There's a thermos, a
steaming cup of coffee, and a Twinkie with a single bite
out of it beside the TV. The chair is empty, except for a
jacket slung across the back, the word SECURITY stitched
on the breast. The guard is nowhere in sight.
Sykes moves toward the table, taking in this eerie sight.
He looks around, then continues on.
INT. WAREHOUSE - APPROACHING STAIRS - NIGHT
Jetson moves among the dark nooks and crannies, comes to a
set of stairs leading to an upper floor. The top of the
stairs is pitch black. Jetson adjusts his grip on the
shotgun, slowly starts up the stairs.
INT. WAREHOUSE - AT FISH NETS - NIGHT
Sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging
from the ceiling. He has no alternate route -- he begins
pushing through them.
SYKES' POV - MOVING THROUGH FISH NETS
Because of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack
of nets immediately before him. He keeps wading through
-- it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much
farther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the
deeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the
way he came. He pushes past one particular rack of nets
and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is--
-- a terrifying face!
ON SYKES
He stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the
Casull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is.
It's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship.
The wood is worm-eaten and decayed, creating a hideous
visage. Sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump-start
his heart again.
INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT
Jetson moves along the rickety planks. He comes to a
door. He eases it open, enters.
INT. SECOND FLOOR ROOM - NIGHT
Jetson moves into the shadowy confines. He hears an
incessant drip from a sink faucet in the corner. He moves
to it. Turns the spigot, stopping the drip. Other drips
are HEARD from a dozen other hidden recesses all around
him. He glances up at the filthy mirror attached to the
wall above the sink. Suddenly he sees the movement of
something behind him. He spins with the shotgun. A huge
shadow moves along the wall. He pivots the shotgun again
-- toward the source of the shadow.
It's a length of black tarp, torn and flapping from the
ceiling. Jetson lets out a deep breath.
INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
ANGLE down a short passageway to an intersecting hallway.
A strand of something hangs in FRAME in OUT OF FOCUS F.G.
It makes an indistinct, rhythmic CLINKING SOUND. Sykes
moves along the intersecting hallway. The CLINKING SOUND
catches his attention. He stops, listens, then starts
down the passageway, toward us.
He comes forward into the storage room, having to get very
close to the strand of something before he sees what it
is. It's a double strand of chain, CLINKING gently
against itself. Sykes reaches out, steadies the chain,
silencing it. He considers. It could've been a natural
occurrence... or something could have brushed against it,
setting it in motion. He tightens his grip on the Casull,
backing away from the chain. He senses something behind
him and spins. Nothing there. He relaxes. However--
Behind him now, in SOFT FOCUS, we glimpse movement at the
other end of the short passageway. It is a figure, moving
slowly forward down the passageway, back-lit by the
hallway light behind it, its shadow filling the passageway
as it approaches Sykes. It stops, inside the room now,
directly behind Sykes. Close enough to reach out and
touch him. It is an alien silhouette, but larger, more
powerful.
Suddenly, Sykes senses something is there. He turns,
slowly, and--
SHOCK CUT - HARCOURT
as he steps from the shadows -- just like he did the last
time Sykes saw him on the abandoned drawbridge. Only this
time it is a horribly transformed Harcourt. His eyes are
red-rimmed and piggish. His head is lumpen, his skin
thick and hard. His neck muscles are corded -- giving him
a kind of hellish cobra's cowl. There is still
intelligence behind the eyes -- but it is a feral
intelligence now.
HARCOURT
(his voice a guttural
rumble)
Looking for me, Sergeant?
Sykes stumbles back several steps, wildly brings up the
Casull, and fires. The powerful Casull round catches
Harcourt in the shoulder, jerking him back.
EXT. WORK SHED AREA - NIGHT
Jetson, in another area of the docks, hears the echoing
blast of the Casull. He gauges as best he can the
direction it came from and takes off running.
INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
Harcourt recovers from the jolt of the bullet impact. The
cloth of his disheveled shirt is shredded and powder-
burned, but the bullet couldn't pierce his plated skin.
Harcourt smiles with grotesquely altered teeth, starts
toward Sykes.
Scared shitless, Sykes rapid-fires. One of his shots
misses, shattering a crate beside Harcourt's head. The
remaining shots strike Harcourt full on. Harcourt is
jerked by the impact of the bullets each time, SNARLING in
anger -- but none of the hits stop him. The Casull is
empty and Harcourt keeps coming.
Sykes stumbles back, but Harcourt is on him in a flash.
Harcourt grabs Sykes' arm holding the gun, yanks hard. We
HEAR the POP as the shoulder dislocates. Sykes HOLLERS,
and the gun jumps out of his hand.
INT. WAREHOUSE - GUARD'S AREA - NIGHT
Jetson races in, shotgun ready. The last of Sykes' shots
are still ECHOING. Jetson looks around, frustrated,
unable to tell exactly where they are coming from. He
sees the likely path and charges that way.
EXT. DOCK - AT STAIRS - NIGHT
On the CUT, Sykes' body is already tumbling down these
rickety stairs attached to the side of the warehouse,
having been thrown ruthlessly from above. As Sykes' body
sprawls on the dock, the massive figure of Harcourt
appears at the top of the stairs.
Sykes, scraped and bruised, struggles to his feet.
Harcourt moves down the stairs, then vaults over the
railing the last fifteen feet. Harcourt lurches forward
and, with a taloned grip on Sykes' shoulders, propels him
down the docks.
EXT. STREET NEAR DOCKS - NIGHT
The first two arriving black-and-whites skid to stops at
the coroner's wagon. The Officers leap out, flagging
other arriving units to continue on toward the warehouses.
EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT
Sykes is on his feet, but his knees buckle, and he almost
collapses again. Harcourt comes at him. Then Sykes sees
it--
-- a fishing boat chugging along past the end of one of
the jetties. Sykes makes a break for it.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - AT STAIRS - NIGHT
Jetson charges out at the top of the rickety stairs,
frantically scanning for any sign of Sykes. Then, in the
distance, he spots the two figures running along the jetty
-- Sykes being chased by the re-formed Harcourt. Jetson
gives the water surrounding the docks an apprehensive
look, then gathers up his courage, and races down the
stairs to help Sykes.
EXT. JETTY - NIGHT
Sykes lumbers along the narrow jetty. The fishing boat is
already passing the end of the jetty. Harcourt is fast
behind Sykes as he reaches the end of the jetty and vaults
off toward the stern of the boat -- landing on the fishing
net piled on the rear deck. He yells in pain as his ankle
twists under his weight.
EXT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Sykes lies there, holding his arm, breathing hard,
relieved that he has escaped.
EXT. JETTY - NIGHT
Harcourt can't reach the boat from the same jetty Sykes
did, so he jumps on a platform beside this jetty, then
onto a second jetty. And from here, he vaults across the
seawater onto the boat.
EXT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Sykes sees the phantom figure land on the boat near the
cabin. The fishing boat chugs up the channel toward the
open sea.
EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT
Jetson sees this and is shitting bricks. Suddenly the
stark BEAM of a police helicopter sun-gun stabs down from
above. Jetson looks up to see the chopper coming in low,
the sun-gun washing over the docks.
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
The sun-gun hits Jetson standing on the dock, frantically
waving his badge at the 'copter, signaling it down. The
Pilot starts to take it down.
EXT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Sykes is on all fours, clawing his way up the fishing net
toward the back of the boat. Harcourt gets one hand on
his leg. Sykes jerks his leg away, and Harcourt's claws
dig deep through Sykes' pants into his legs as he pulls
away. Sykes BELLOWS in pain.
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Jetson is barely in the seat as it lifts away from the
dock. He has to catch himself from falling out the open
door. Below, uniformed cops are now seen rushing out onto
the dock.
JETSON
On that boat -- out there!
Jetson indicates the fishing boat headed toward the mouth
of the channel. The helicopter tilts forward and goes.
EXT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Sykes manages to pull himself up into the dinghy hanging
over the stern of the fishing boat. He pushes to the back
of the dinghy as Harcourt's savage visage appears at the
bow. Harcourt grins -- the predator with his prey
trapped.
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Jetson's face is bathed in sweat as he looks out at the
channel water racing past beneath. They come up on the
boat and the Pilot plays the sun-gun onto the deck,
looking for movement, finally pinning Sykes and Harcourt
at the stern dinghy.
EXT. BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
The Captain reacts to the helicopter overhead, looks back
at what the sun-gun spotlights. He sees Harcourt standing
at the bow of the dinghy, starting to clamber in.
CAPTAIN
Hey!
EXT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Harcourt turns, sees the Captain on the bridge above him.
He reaches for a wood-handled gaff nearby. He rears back
with it and lets it fly like a spear.
EXT. BRIDGE OF FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
The gaff impales the Captain, off-center in his chest.
The Captain, his face frozen in shock, is thrown back
against the throttle. The boat lunges forward as the
engines REV loudly.
EXT. FISHING BOAT - NIGHT
Harcourt is thrown into the dinghy with Sykes. As
Harcourt recovers, Sykes spots the release for the tie
line on the dinghy. He lunges forward, throwing the
ratchet. The line plays out, and the dinghy slides
backward into water!
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Jetson watches this happen.
EXT. DINGHY - NIGHT
The dinghy bangs along (at the end of the ten foot tie
line) in the wake of the speeding fishing boat.
Harcourt claws his way toward Sykes. Water is already
splashing in over the stern transom... the dinghy is
sinking. Harcourt grabs Sykes' leg and pulls him toward
him. Sykes holds on to the stern cleats with all his
might. Harcourt yanks him free. Sykes kicks wildly at
the ratchet release, trying to free the remainder of the
line. Harcourt is coming in for the kill when--
-- Sykes' foot connects with the ratchet lever. The rest
of the tie line snakes through the ratchet, freeing the
dinghy from the fishing boat!
The dinghy is rocking wildly, sinking fast. A wave from
the fishing boat's wake splashes in over the side. Some
of it hits Harcourt -- he HOWLS and falls away. Sykes
sees this, tries to clamber over the side, but Harcourt is
on him again. Sykes' body weight at the side of the
dinghy coupled with the rocking motion cause more water to
wash in over the transom.
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Jetson reacts to Sykes and Harcourt battling in the dinghy
below.
EXT. DINGHY - NIGHT
Harcourt, who is getting more and more wet, HOWLS in
agony, thick blood beginning to bead wherever the water
touches. Sykes is taking one hell of a beating. Harcourt
sweeps Sykes up in a bear hug, is about to crush his rib
cage, when Sykes shifts his body weight, knocking Harcourt
off balance. Harcourt wobbles, fear on his face for the
first time -- then he finally loses it, and the two of
them tumble overboard into the water, capsizing the
dinghy.
EXT. WATER - NIGHT
Sykes breaks the surface, gasping for air, frantically
clawing with his one good arm at the wedge of dinghy still
above the water. Suddenly, behind him, Harcourt's
partially melted form erupts from the water, lunges on top
of Sykes, and drags him under.
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Jetson hangs in the open door, watching in horror, wanting
to help, knowing he can't.
EXT. WATER - NIGHT
Sykes breaks the surface, Harcourt's misshapen lump of a
body unmoving but still on top of him. Sykes shoves it
away, struggling to stay afloat. His head keeps dunking
under. He's drowning.
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Jetson screws up his courage and turns to the Pilot.
JETSON
Take it down! Take it down!
EXT. WATER AND HELICOPTER - NIGHT
The helicopter moves down toward the turbulent water.
Jetson hangs in the doorway, watching Sykes' head dunking
under again. The helicopter's skids are three feet above
the water.
JETSON
(to Pilot)
ALL THE WAY!
PILOT
I CAN'T IT'LL DITCH!
Sykes' outreached hand stretches up from the water, but
the skid is just too high. Jetson has no alternative, and
he does the bravest thing he has ever done. He moves out
onto the narrow helicopter skid. Hanging on, three feet
above the water, he reaches down for Sykes' up reaching
hand.
The fingertips of the two hands waver mere inches from
each other... Jetson stretches farther, farther... and the
two hands meet! Jetson winces from the pain of the
seawater on Sykes' hand. He starts pulling Sykes up.
When--
HARCOURT'S HEAD BREAKS THE SURFACE A FOOT FROM SYKES'
FACE. His eye sockets are empty and his skin is mostly
gone. The nearly skeletal body heaves blindly onto Sykes,
breaking his grip from Jetson's, and dragging him under
again.
Jetson is frantic. He keeps waiting -- but this time
Sykes doesn't come up. Jetson doesn't know what to do.
Finally -- he leans down as far as he can, his face a foot
from the water, SCREAMS to block the pain, and plunges his
own arm below the surface! He feels around, gets hold of
something, and pulls. It is Sykes' wrist. He pulls hard,
bringing the sputtering Sykes up out of the water.
JETSON
(to Pilot)
Take it up!
The Pilot does. Sykes comes up out of the water. His
feet are just clear of the surface when -- Harcourt's hand
and arm rocket out of the water, grabbing Sykes' ankle.
Sykes looks down in horror. The helicopter keeps moving
up, and before Harcourt's body breaks the surface, the arm
tears away from the torso at the shoulder. Sykes wildly
shakes the clinging severed arm from his ankle, and it
falls back into the water below.
Jetson continues pulling him up into the helicopter as it
moves off toward shore.
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Sykes plops on the floor, soaked, battered, holding his
limp arm. Jetson is quickly whipping off his jacket,
wrapping the dry part around his own arm, wincing in pain.
The Pilot stare down at the circle of water where they
just pulled Sykes from.
PILOT
What the hell was that down there?
It was weird.
Jetson looks at Sykes, wondering if he will say. Sykes
looks at Jetson a long moment, then--
SYKES
Looked like every other damn slag to
me. Just plain ugly.
Despite the pain, Jetson smiles.
LONG DISSOLVE TO:
INT. CHURCH ANTEROOM - DAY
We are CLOSE on Sykes, who is having a hell of a time,
trying to tie a tuxedo tie with one arm in a sling. A
PAIR OF ALIEN ARMS reach into FRAME to help him. One of
the alien arms is also in a sling.
ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the alien is Jetson. Both men wear
tuxedos.
SYKES
How do I look?
JETSON
You look very good.
There's a knock at the door. Sykes opens it. There
stands Sykes' daughter, KRISTIN, twenty years old, looking
radiant in her wedding dress. She is in a foyer, and
behind her is the interior of the church with all the
assembled guests, including Mrs. Jetson & son.
KRISTIN
Ready, Daddy...?
Sykes' heart melts. Before moving to the door:
SYKES
George, uh... I want to apologize
now, in advance, for all the rotten
things I'll ever say or do to you
over the years.
Sykes moves to join his daughter. As he does:
JETSON
That is all right, Matthew. After
all, you are only human.
Sykes, caught off guard, has to laugh.
SYKES
(under his breath)
What a wildman...
Sykes takes his daughter's arm and the two of them start
down the aisle.
FADE OUT.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALIENS
FADE IN
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE - SPACE 1
Silent and endless. The stars shine like the love of
God...cold and remote. Against them drifts a tiny chip
of technology.
CLOSER SHOT It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the
ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo. Without interior
or running lights it seems devoid of life. The PING
of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer. A shadow
engulfs the Narcissus. Searchlights flash on, playing
over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
toward it.
INT. NARCISSUS 2
Dark and dormant as a crypt. The searchlights stream
in the dusty windows. Outside, massive metal forms can
BE SEEN descending around the shuttle. Like the tolling
of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through
the hull.
CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR Light glares as a cutting
torch bursts through the metal. Sparks shower into the
room.
A second torch cuts through. They move with machine
precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging. The
torches meet. Cut off. The door falls inward REVEALING
a bizarre multi-armed figure. A ROBOT WELDER.
FIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous. THREE MEN in
bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment. They
approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g.
LEADER
(filtered)
Internal pressure positive. Assume
nominal hull integrity. Hypersleep
capsules, style circa late twenties...
His gloved hand wipes at on opaque layer of dust on the
canopy.
ANGLE INSIDE CAPSULE as light stabs in where the dust is
wiped away, illuminating a WOMAN, her face in peaceful
repose.
WARRANT OFFICER RIPLEY, sole survivor of the Nostromo.
Nestled next to her is JONES, the ship's wayward cat.
LEADER
(voice over; filtered)
Lights are green. She's alive.
Well, there goes out salvage, guys.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY STATION 3
She's lying in a bed, looking wan, as a female MED-TECH
raises the backrest. She is surrounded by arcane white
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. The Med-Tech exudes practiced
cheeriness.
MED-TECH
Why don't I open the viewport?
Watch your eyes.
Harsh light floods in as a motorized shield slides into
the ceiling, REVEALING a breathtaking vista. Beyond the
sprawling complex of modular habitats, collectively
called GATEWAY STATION, is the curve of EARTH as seen
from high orbit. Blue and serene.
MED-TECH
And how are we today?
RIPLEY
(weakly)
Terrible.
MED-TECH
Just terrible? That's better
than yesterday at least.
RIPLEY
How long have I been on
Gateway station?
MED-TECH
Just a couple of days. Do you
feel up to a visitor?
Ripley shrugs, not caring. The door opens and a MAN
enters, although Ripley sees only what he is carrying.
A familiar large, orange TOMCAT.
RIPLEY
Jones!
She grabs the cat like a life preserver.
RIPLEY
(cooing baby-cat talk)
Come here Jonesy you ugly old
moose...you ugly thing.
Jones patiently endures Ripley's embarrassing display,
seeming none the worse for wear. The visitor sits
beside the bed and Ripley finally notices him. He is
thirtyish and handsome, in a suit that looks executive
or legal, the tie loosened with studied casualness. A
smile referred to as ""winning.""
MAN
Nice room. I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
I work for the company, but other
than that I'm an okay guy. Glad to
see you're feeling better. I'm told
the weakness and disorientation
should pass soon. Side effects of
the unusually long hypersleep, or
something like that.
RIPLEY
How long was I out there? They
won't tell me anything.
BURKE
(soothing)
Well, maybe you shouldn't worry
about that just yet.
Ripley grabs his arm, surprising him.
RIPLEY
How long?
Burke gazes at her, thoughtful.
BURKE
All right. My instinct says
you're strong enough to handle
this...Fifty-seven years.
Ripley is stunned. She seems to deflate, her expression
passing through amazement and shock to realization of
all she has lost. Friends. Family. Her world.
RIPLEY
Fifty-seven...oh, Christ...
BURKE
You'd drifted right through the
core systems. It's blind luck that
deep-salvage team caught you when
they...are you all right?
Ripley coughs suddenly as if choking and her expression
becomes one of dawning horror. Burke hands her a glass
of water from the nightstand. She slaps it away. It
shatters with a SMASH. Jones dives, yowling. Ripley
grabs her chest, struggling as if she is strangling.
The Med-Tech hits a console button.
MED-TECH
(shouting)
Code Blue! 415. Code Blue!
4-1-5!
Burke and the Med-Tech are holding Ripley's shoulders as
she goes into convulsions. A DOCTOR and TWO TECHS run
in. Ripley's back arches in agony.
RIPLEY
No...noooo!
They try to restrain her as she thrashes, knocking over
equipment. Her EKG races like mad. Jones, under a
cabinet, hisses wide-eyed.
DOCTOR
Hold her...Get me an airway, stat!
And fifteen cc's of...Jesus!
AN EXPLOSION OF BLOOD beneath the sheet covering her
chest! Ripley stares at the SHAPE RISING UNDER THE
SHEET. Tearing itself out of her.
HER P.O.V. as the sheet rises. A GLIMPSE OF the
CHITTERING HORROR...IT SCREECHES.
TIGHT ON RIPLEY screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
Alone in the darkened hospital room. She gasps for
breath, clutching pathetically at her chest. There is
no demented horror rigging itself out of her. Her eyes
snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
her safety. Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.
A VIDEO MONITOR beside the bed snaps on. A MED-TECH's
face.
MED-TECH
Bad dreams again? Do you want
something to help you sleep?
RIPLEY
(faint)
No.. I've slept enough.
The Med-Tech shrugs and switches off. Touching a button
on the nightstand she opens the viewport, REVEALING
Gateway and the turquoise Earth. She hugs Jones to her
and rocks with him like a child, still shattered by the
nightmare. Shivering. Sleep is far off.
RIPLEY
We made it, Jones. We made it.
But at what price?
CUT TO:
EXT. PARK 4
Sunlight streams in shafts through a stand of poplars,
beyond which a verdant meadow is VISIBLE.
EXTREME F.G. Jones stalks toward a bird hopping among
fallen leaves. He leaps. And smack into A WALL.
RIPLEY
(voice over)
Dumbshit.
WIDER ANGLE as Jones steps back confused from the
HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL WALL SCREEN, a sort of
cinerama video-loop. Ripley sits on a bench in what we
now SEE is an ATRIUM off the medical center, still
somewhere in the bowels of Gateway Station. Benches.
Some unenthusiastic potted trees. The sterile corridors
VISIBLE beyond glass doors b.g.
Burke ENTERS in his usual mode, casual haste.
BURKE
Sorry...I've been running behind
all morning.
Ripley seems healthier now, but still a bit brittle.
RIPLEY
Have they located my daughter
yet?
BURKE
Well, I was going to wait
until after the inquest...
He opens his briefcase, removing a sheet of printer
hard copy, including a telestat photo.
RIPLEY
Is she...?
BURKE
(scanning)
Amanda Ripley-McClaren. Married
name, I guess. Age: sixty-six
...at time of death. Two years
ago.
(looks at her)
I'm sorry.
Ripley studies the PHOTOGRAPH, stunned.
The face of a woman in her mid-sixties. It could be
anybody. She tries to reconcile the face with the
little girl she once knew.
RIPLEY
Amy.
BURKE
(reading)
Cancer. Hmmmm. They still haven't
licked that one. Cremated. Interred
Parkside Repository, Little Chute,
Wisconsin. No children.
Ripley gazes off, into the pseudo-landscape, into the
past.
RIPLEY
I promised her I'd be home for
her birthday. Her eleventh
birthday. I sure missed that
one.
(pause)
Well...she has already learned
to take my promises with a grain
of salt. When it came to flight
schedules, anyway.
Burke nods, a simpatico presence.
RIPLEY
You always think you can make it
up to somebody...later, you know.
But now I never can. I never
can.
Let's get one thing straight...Ripley can be one tough
lady. But the terror, the loss, the emptiness are, in
this moment, overwhelming. She cries silently.
Burke puts a reassuring hand on her arm.
BURKE
(gently)
The hearing convenes at 0930. You
don't want to be late.
INT. CORRIDOR - GATEWAY 5
Elevator doors part and Ripley emerges, in mid-conversation
with Burke. DOLLYING AHEAD OF THEM as they move rapidly
down the corridor.
RIPLEY
You read my deposition...it's
complete and accurate.
BURKE
Look, I believe you, but there are
going to be some heavyweights in
there. You got Feds, you got
interstellar commerce commission,
you got colonial administration,
insurance company guys...
RIPLEY
I get the picture.
BURKE
Just tell them what happened. The
important thing is to stay cool
and unemotional.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON RIPLEY - GATEWAY 6
She's not cool. Not unemotional.
RIPLEY
Do you people have earwax, of
what? We have been here three
hours. How many different ways
do you want me to tell the same
story?
She faces the EIGHT MEMBERS of the board of inquiry at a
long conference table. Gray suits and grim faces. They
aren't buying. Behind Ripley on a large VIDEO SCREEN,
PARKER grins like a goon from his personnel mugshot. His
file prints out next to it. BRETT's face and dossier
replace it, and then the others as the SCENE continues...
KANE, LAMBERT, ASH the android traitor, DALLAS.
VAN LEUWEN, the ICC representative, steeples his fingers
and frowns.
VAN LEUWEN
Look at it from our perspective.
You freely admit to detonating the
engines of, and thereby destroying,
an M-Class star-freighter. A
rather expensive piece of hardware...
INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR
(dryly)
Forty-two million in adjusted dollars.
That's minus payload, of course.
VAN LEUWEN
The shuttle's flight recorder
corroborates some elements of
your account. That the Nostromo
set down on LV-426, an unsurveyed
planet, at that time. That
repairs were made. That it resumed
its course and was subsequently set
for self-destruct. By you. For
reasons unknown.
RIPLEY
Look, I told you...
VAN LEUWEN
It did not, however, contain any
entries concerning the hostile
life form you allegedly picked up.
Ripley sense the noose tightening.
RIPLEY
Then somebody's gotten to it...
doctored the recorder. Who had
access to it?
The ECA (Extrasolar Colonization Administration)
Representative (ECA REP) just shakes his head.
ECA REP
Would you just listen to yourself
for one minute.
Ripley glares at the ECA Rep, a woman on the ungenerous
side of fifty. Van Leuwen sighs with exasperation.
VAN LEUWEN
The analysis team which went over
your shuttle centimeter by
centimeter found no physical
evidence of the creature you
describe...
RIPLEY
(losing it)
That's because I blew it out the
Goddamn airlock!
(pause)
Like I said.
INSURANCE MAN
(to ECA Rep)
Are there any species like this
'hostile organism' on LV-426?
ECA REP
No. It's a rock. No indigenous
life larger than a simple virus.
Ripley grits her teeth in frustration.
RIPLEY
I told you, it wasn't indigenous.
There was an alien spacecraft there.
A derelict ship. We homed on its
beacon...
ECA REP
To be perfectly frank, we've surveyed
over three hundred worlds and no one's
ever reported a creature which, using
your words...
(read from Ripley's
statement)
...'gestates in a living human host'
and has 'concentrated molecular acid
for blood.'
Ripley glances at Burke, silent at the far end of the
table. His expression is grim. Her mouth hardens as
a bit of the old nail-eating Ripley surfaces.
RIPLEY
Look, I can see where this is
going. But I'm telling you those
things exist. Back on that planetoid
is an alien ship and on that ship
are thousands of eggs. Thousands.
Do you understand? I suggest you
find it, using the flight recorder's
data. Find it and deal with it --
before one of your survey teams
comes back with a little surprise...
VAN LEUWEN
Thank you, Officer Ripley. That
will be...
RIPLEY
(louder, stepping
on him)
...because just one of those
things managed to kill my entire
crew, within twelve hours of
hatching...
Van Leuwen stands, out of patience.
VAN LEUWEN
Thank you, that will be all.
Ripley stares him down, glowering at the board.
RIPLEY
That's not all, Goddamnit! If
those things get back here, that
will be all. Then you can just
kiss it good-bye, Jack! Just kiss
it goodbye.
Ripley turns sharply away, trembling with frustration
and anger. Dallas looks back at her from the video
screen, his eyes burning from the photograph, as we:
CUT TO:
INT. CORRIDOR 7
Ripley kicks the wall next to Burke who is getting coffee
and donuts at a vending machine.
BURKE
You had them eating out of your
hand, kiddo.
RIPLEY
They had their minds made up
before I even went in there.
They think I'm a head case.
BURKE
(cheerfully)
You are a head case. Have a donut.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - LATER 8
Van Leuwen clears his throat.
VAN LEUWEN
It is the finding of this board of
inquiry that Warrent Officer Ellen Ripley,
NOC-14672. has acted with questionable
judgment and is unfit to hold an
ICC license as a commercial flight
officer.
Burke watches Ripley taking it on the chin, white-lipped
but subdued.
VAN LEUWEN
Said license is hereby suspended
indefinitely. No criminal charges
will be filed at this time and you
are released on own recognizance
for a six month period of
psychometric probation, to include
monthly review by an ICC psychiatric
tech...
INT. CORRIDOR 9
DOLLY BACK as the conference room door bangs open and
Ripley strides through. She shrugs off Burke's
restraining arm and catches up to Van Leuwen walking
down the corridor.
RIPLEY
(insistent)
Why won't you check out LV-426?
VAN LEUWEN
(condescendingly)
Because I don't have to. The
people who live there checked it
out years ago and they never
reported and 'hostile organism'
or alien ship. And by the way,
they call it Acheron now.
RIPLEY
What are you talking about.
What people?
Van Leuwen steps into an elevator with some others, but
Ripley holds the door from closing.
VAN LEUWEN
Terraformers...planet engineers.
It's what we call a shake 'n' bake
colony. They set up atmosphere
processors to make the air
breathable...big job. Takes
decades. They've already been
there over twenty years. Peacefully.
The door tries to close. Ripley slams it back. People
are getting annoyed.
RIPLEY
How many colonists?
VAN LEUWEN
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
RIPLEY
(low)
Sweet Jesus.
ELEVATOR PASSENGER
Do you mind?
Ripley's hand slides off the door, strengthless.
TIGHT ON HER FROM INSIDE the elevator as the doors close
like fate on her lost expression.
EXT. ALIEN LANDSCAPE - DAY 10
A hideous, storm-blasted vista. Tortured rock forms.
Bleak twilight at midday.
PAN SLOWLY ONTO a CORRODED METAL SIGN set in concrete
pylons, which reads:
HADLEY'S HOPE - POP. 159
""WELCOME TO ACHERON""
Some local has added below in spray-can graffiti
""Have a nice day."" Gale-force wind SCREECHES around
the steel sign, driving a freezing rain.
The COLONY, b.g., is a squat complex with lots of
floodlights.
EXT. COLONY COMPLEX 11
The town is a cluster of bunkerlike metal and concrete
buildings connected by conduits. Neon signs throw garish
colors across the vaultlike walls, advertising bars and
other businesses. It looks like a sodden cross between
the Krupps munitions works and a truckstop casino in
the Nevada boondocks.
Huge-wheeled tractors crawl toadlike in the rutted
""street"" and vanish down rampways to underground garages.
ANGLE ON THE CONTROL BLOCK the largest structure. It
resembles vaguely the superstructure of an aircraft
carrier...a flying bridge.
VISIBLE across a half kilometer of barren heath, b.g.,
is the massive complex of the nearest ATMOSPHERE
PROCESSOR, looking like a power plant bred with an active
volcano. Its fiery glow pulses in the low cloud cover
like a steel mill.
INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - NEAR CONTROL BLOCK 12
A central space, laid out like a scaled-down shopping
mall with no styling flourishes. We SEE a cross section
of the types of people who have come to live on
Godforsaken Acheron. Tough. Pragmatic. ""Grapes of
Wrath"" faces. Calloused hands. Not too many interior
decorators. Some children race in the corridor on things
that look suspiciously like ""Big Wheels.""
INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - CONTROL BLOCK 13
Jammed with computer terminals, technicians, displays...
most of the business of running the colony flows through
here. It's high tech but used and scrungy. Papers
piled up. Coffee cup rings.
DOLLY AHEAD OF LYDECKER, the Assistant Operations Manager,
as he catches up to the harried Operating Manager,
SIMPSON.
LYDECKER
You remember you sent some
wildcatters out to that
plateau, out past the Ilium
range, a couple days ago?
SIMPSON
Yeah. What?
LYDECKER
There's a guy on the horn,
mom-and-pop survey team. Says
he's homing on something and
wants to know if his claim will
be honored.
SIMPSON
Christ. Some honch in a cushy
office on Earth says go look at
a grid reference in the middle
of nowhere, we look. They don't
say why, and I don't ask. I
don't ask because it takes two
weeks to get an answer out here
and the answer's always 'don't
ask.'
LYDECKER
So what do I tell this guy?
SIMPSON
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
he finds something it's his.
EXT. ACHERON - THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - A SIX-WHEELED 14
TRACTOR - DAY
It roars across corrugated rock, blasting through soggy
drifts of volcanic ash.
INT. TRACTOR 15
At the controls, intent on a PINGING scope, is RUSS JORDEN,
independent prospector. Beside him is his wife/partner
ANNE and in the back their two kids are playing among the
heavy sampling equipment.
JORDEN
(gloating cackle)
Look at this fat, juicy magnetic
profile. And it's mine, mine,
mine.
ANNE
Half mine, dear.
NEWT, their six-year-old daughter, yells from the back...
NEWT
And half mine!
JORDEN
I got too many partners.
NEWT
Daddy, when are we going back
to town?
JORDEN
When we get rich, Newt.
NEWT
You always say that. I wanna go
back. I wanna play 'Monster Maze.'
Her older brother TIM sticks his jeering face close to
hers.
TIM
You cheat too much.
NEWT
Do not. I'm just the best.
TIM
Do too! You go in places we
can't fit.
NEWT
So! That's why I'm the best.
ANNE
Knock it off! I catch either of
you playing in the air ducts again
I'll tan your hides.
NEWT
Mom. All the kids play it...
JORDEN
(reverently)
Holy shiiit!
ANGLE THROUGH FRONT CANOPY ON a bizarre shape looming
ahead. An enormous bonelike mass projecting upward from
the bed of ash. The tractor slows.
Canted on its side and buckles against a rock outcropping
by the lava flow, it is still recognizable as an
EXTRATERRESTRIAL SHIP. Bio-mechanoid. Nonhuman design.
JORDEN
Folks, we have scored big this
time.
EXT. TRACTOR 16
Jorden and Anne step down, wearing ENVIRONMENT SUITS.
Carrying LIGHTS, PACKS, CAMERAS, TEST GEAR. Their
breath clouds in the chill air.
ANNE
You kids stay inside. I mean
it! We'll be right back.
They trudge toward the alien derelict.
ANNE
Shouldn't we call in?
JORDEN
Let's wait till we know what to
call it in as.
ANNE
(nervous)
How about 'big weird thing'?
They pause at a twisted gash in the hull. Blackness
inside.
INT./EXT. TRACTOR 17
Newt has her face pressed to the glass, steaming it.
Watching her parents enter the strange ship. Tim GRABS
HER from behind. She SHRIEKS.
TIM
Cheater!
EXT. LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 18
The tractor and the derelict are dark and motionless.
The wind HOWLS around them.
Tim is curled up in the driver's seat. Newt shakes him
awake, trying hard not to cry.
NEWT
Timmy...they've been gone a
long time.
Tim considers the night. The wind. The vast landscape.
He bites his lip.
TIM
(quavering)
It'll be okay, Newt. Dad knows
what he's doing.
CRASH! Newt SCREAMS as the door beside her is RIPPED
OPEN. A dark shape lunges inside!
Anne, panting and terrified, grabs the dash mike.
ANNE
Mayday! Mayday! This is
Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner
calling Hadley Control.
Repeat. This is...
As Anne shouts the mayday Newt looks past her, to the
ground. Russ Jorden lies there inert, dragged somehow
by Anne from inside the ship. There is SOMETHING ON
HIS FACE. An appalling MULTILEGGED CREATURE, pulsing
with obscene life. Newt begins to SCREAM hysterically,
competing with the shrieking wind which rises to a
crescendo as we:
CUT TO:
INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - GATEWAY - DAY 20
Silence. Ripley, looking haggard, sits at a table in
the dining alcove contemplating the smoke rising from
her cigarette. The place is modest, to be charitable,
and there are few personal touches. Though it's late
in the day Ripley is still wearing a robe. The bed is
unmade. Dishes in the sink. Jones prowls across the
counter. The WALLSCREEN is on, blaring vapidly.
VOICE FROM VIDEO
(o.s.)
Hey, Bob! I heard you and the
family are heading off for the
colonies!
BON
(o.s.)
Best decision I ever made, Bill.
We'll be starting a new life
from scratch, in a clean world.
No crime. No unemployment...
The door BUZZES. Ripley jumps like a cat. Jones doesn't.
INT. CORRIDOR 21
Carter Burke stands in the narrow, dingy corridor with
LIEUTENANT GORMAN, Colonial Marine Corps. Young and
severe in his officer's dress-black. The door opens
slightly.
BURKE
Hi, Ripley. This is
Lieutenant Gorman of the...
SLAM. Burke buzzes again. Talks to the door...
BURKE
Ripley we have to talk.
(pause)
They've lost contact with the
colony on Acheron.
The door opens. Ripley considers the ramifications of
that. She motions them inside.
INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER 22
Burke and Gorman are seated, nursing coffee. Ripley
paces, very tense.
RIPLEY
No. There's no way!
BURKE
Hear me out...
RIPLEY
I was reamed, steamed and
dry-cleaned by you guys...and
now you want me to go back out
there? Forget it.
We SEE that she's gut scared, covering it with anger.
Burke sees it.
BURKE
Look, we don't know what's going
on out there. It may just be a
down transmitter. But if it's
not, I want you there...as an
advisor. That's all.
GORMAN
You wouldn't be going in with the
troops. I can guarantee your
safety.
BURKE
These Colonial Marines are
some tough hombres, and they're
packing state-of-the-art firepower.
Nothing they can't handle...right,
Lieutenant?
GORMAN
(cool)
We're trained to deal with these
kinds of situations.
RIPLEY
(to Burke)
What about you? What's your
interest in this?
BURKE
Well, the corporation co-financed
that colony with the Colonial
Administration, against mineral
rights. We're getting into a lot
of terraforming...'Building Better
Worlds.'
Burke is revealing his early days in sales.
RIPLEY
Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial.
BURKE
I heard you were working in the
cargo docks.
RIPLEY
(defensive)
That's right.
BURKE
Running loaders, forklifts, that
sort of thing?
RIPLEY
(shrugging)
It's all I could get. Anyway,
it keeps my mind off of...
everything. Days off are worse.
BURKE
What if I said I could get you
reinstated as a flight officer?
And that the company has agreed
to pick up your contract?
RIPLEY
If I go.
BURKE
If you go.
(pause)
It's a second chance, kiddo. And
it'll be the best thing in the
world for you to face this fear
and beat it. You gotta get back
on the horse...
RIPLEY
(frosty)
Spare me, Burke. I've had my
psych evaluation this month.
Burke leans close, a let's-cut-the-crap intimacy.
BURKE
Yes, and I've read it. You
wake up every night, sheets
soaking, the same nightmare
over and over...
RIPLEY
(shouting)
No! The answer is no. Now
please go. I'm sorry. Just
go, would you.
Burke nods to Gorman who rises with him. He slips a
TRANSLUCENT CARD onto the table, heads for the door.
BURKE
Think about it.
EXT. ACHERON LANDSCAPE - NIGHT 23
As the wind HOWLS through tormented rock, BUILDING IN
PITCH until we:
CUT TO:
INT. APARTMENT 24
Ripley lunges INTO FRAME with an animal outcry. She
clutches her chest, breathing hard. Bathed in sweat
she lights a cigarette with trembling hands. Do we
hear a faint, desolate wind?
TIGHT ON PHONE CONSOLE as Ripley's hand inserts Burke's
card into a slot. ""STAND BY"" prints out on the screen
and is replaced by Burke's face, bleary with sleep.
BURKE
(on video phone)
Yello? Oh, Ripley. Hi...
RIPLEY
Burke, just tell me one thing.
That you're going out there to
kill them. Not study. Not bring
back. Just burn them out...clean
...forever.
BURKE
That's the plan. My word on it.
CLOSEUP - RIPLEY taking a deep slow breath. It's time
to look the demon in the eye.
RIPLEY
All right. I'm in.
She punches off before Burke replies, before she can
change her mind. She turns to Jones sitting on the
bed and her tone becomes admonishing...
RIPLEY
And you my dear, are staying
right here.
Jones blinks, cynical cat eyes...""count me right
out.""
CUT TO:
EXT. DEEP SPACE - THREE WEEKS LATER 25
An empty starfield. Metal spires slice ACROSS FRAME.
A mountain of steel following. A massive military
transport ship, the SULACO. Ugly, battered...
functional.
INT. CORRIDOR TO CARGO LOCK 26
An empty corridor, seemingly miles long. No movement.
The THRUMMING of hyperdrive engines.
INT. CARGO LOCK 27
An enormous chamber, cavernous and dark. Squatting
in the shadows are two orbit-to-surface shuttles.
DROP-SHIPS. Heavy machinery all around them...
cranes, loading equipment.
INT. BRIDGE 28
Dark electronic womb. CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY among
murmuring instrumentation. A sudden high-pitched
TRILLING accompanies a sequence of lights. An alarm.
INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT 29
Blackness, until a bank of indicators lights up.
Hydraulics lift a grid of equipment from a row of
horizontal HYPERSLEEP CYLINDERS. It reaches the
ceiling. Locks.
CLOSE ON RIPLEY'S CAPSULE as trickles of water run
down the frosted canopy.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. HYPERSLEEP VAULT 30
Lit up, white and sterile.
The canopies of the row of capsules are raised. Ripley
sits up. Rubs her arms briskly. Next to her Gorman
and Burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers,
wearing shorts and dog tags. They are:
MASTER SERGEANT APONE UNIT LEADER
CORPORAL HICKS B-TEAM LEADER
CORPORAL DIETRICH (female) MED-TECH
PFC HUDSON COM-TECH
PFC VASQUEZ (female) 'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR
PRIVATE DRAKE 'SMART-GUN' OPERATOR
PRIVATE FROST TROOPER
PRIVATE CROWE TROOPER
PRIVATE WIERZBOWSKI TROOPER
CORPORAL FERRO (female) DROP-SHIP PILOT
PFC SPUNKMEYER DROP-SHIP CREW CHIEF
The ship is fully automated in interstellar flight so
there is no crew, except for EXECUTIVE OFFICER (ECA) Bishop,
who supervises planetary maneuvering.
GROANS echo across the chamber.
SPUNKMEYER
Arrgh. I'm getting too old for
this shit.
SPUNKMEYER says this sincerely, though he must have
enlisted underage not long ago. Looking surly, DRAKE
sits up. He's young as well but street-tough. Nasty
scar curling his lip into a sneer.
DRAKE
They ain't payin' us enough
for this.
DIETRICH
Not enough to have to wake up
to your face, Drake.
DRAKE
Suck air. Hey, Hicks...you look
like I feel.
HICKS, an older lifer-type who keeps his own counsel,
just snorts good-naturedly.
Ripley scans the group as they shuffle past her to a
bank of lockers. Though not supermen they are lean and
hardened...tough, capable, jaded. They combine the
specialized techno-combat training of the twenty-first
century fighting man with those qualities universal to
""grunts"" through the ages. SERGEANT APONE moves down the
row of freezers.
HUDSON
This floor's freezing.
APONE
Christ. I never saw such a
buncha old women. You want me
to fetch your slippers, Hudson?
HUDSON
Would you, Sir?
Ripley steps back as the troopers shuffle past nodding
cursory hellos. She feels isolated by the camaraderie
of this tightknit group.
VASQUEZ eyes her coldly as she passes. Like Drake,
Vasquez is younger then the rest and her combat-primer
was the street in a Los Angeles barrio. She is tough
even by the standards of this group. Hard-muscled.
Eyes cunning and mean.
HUDSON
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been
mistaken for a man?
VASQUEZ
No. Have you?
She slaps Drake's open palm and it clenches into a
greeting which is part contest. It gets rougher.
Painful. Until she cuffs him hard and they break with
vicious laughter. Dobermans playing. Conscripted from
juvenile prison, the two of them were trained to
operate the formidable ""SMART-GUNS."" That is part
of their bond.
BISHOP is helping everyone like a valet. As he passes
close to her Ripley notices a strange TATTOO across
the back of his left hand...an ALPHA-NUMERIC CODE.
FROST
Hey, hand job, you take my
towel?
SPUNKMEYER
(overlapping)
I need some slack, man. How
come they send us straight back
out like this? We got some slack
comin', man.
HICKS
You just got three weeks.
SPUNKMEYER
I mean breathing, not this frozen
shit.
DIETRICH
Yeah, 'Top'...what about it?
APONE
You know it ain't up to me.
(louder)
Awright! Let's knock off the
grabass. First assembly's in
fifteen...let's shag it.
INT. SHOWERS 31
High pressure water jets and a blast of hot air when
you step out...a drive through car wash for people.
Through the swirling steam Hudson, Vasquez and FERRO
are watching Ripley dry off.
VASQUEZ
Who's the fresh meat again?
FERRO
She's supposed to be some kinda
consultant...
(exaggerated)
...She was an alien once.
HUDSON
Whoooah! No shit? I'm impressed.
APONE
Let's go...let's go. Cycle through!
INT. MESS HALL 32
An unconscious segregation takes place at the troopers
assemble at one long table while Gorman, Burke, Bishop
and Ripley sit at another. Everybody is nursing a
coffee, waiting for eggs from the AUTOCHEF. Among the
troopers dress discipline is lax...fatigues customized
and emblazoned with patches. Drake's tunic is cut off
to a vest and has ""Eat the apple and fuck the Corps""
stenciled on back. ""Peace Through Superior Firepower,""
""Pray for War"" and ""I've Served My Time in Hell: Cetti
Epsilon NC-104"" are some others.
HUDSON
Hey, 'Top.' What's the op?
APONE
Rescue mission. There's some
juicy colonists' daughters we
gotta rescue from virginity.
Apone is stocky, grizzled, with peregrine eyes. He runs
it loose and fair, but only because he knows his people
are the best.
SPUNKMEYER
Shee-it. Dumbass colonists.
What's this crap supposed to be?
WIERZBOWSKI
Cornbread, I think. Hey, I wouldn't
mind getting me some more a
that Arcturan poontang. Remember
that time?
HICKS
(low)
Looks like that new Lieutenant's
too good to eat with us grunts.
WIERZBOWSKI
(glancing
over shoulder)
Yeah. Got a corn cob up his ass,
definitely.
Across the room, at the other table, Gorman sits with
his creases perfect...the consummate strack NCO. Bishop
takes a seat beside Ripley, who pointedly gets up and
moves to the far side of the table. He looks wounded.
BISHOP
I'm sorry you feel that way
about Synthetics, Ripley.
Ripley spins on Burke, her tone accusing.
RIPLEY
You never said anything about an
android being here! Why not?
BURKE
Well, it didn't occur to me. It's
been policy for years to have a
synthetic on board.
BISHOP
I prefer the term 'artificial person'
myself. Is there a problem?
BURKE
A synthetic malfunctioned on her
last trip out. Some deaths were
involved.
BISHOP
I'm shocked. Was it an older model?
BURKE
Cyberdyne Systems 120-A/2.
Bishop turns to Ripley, very conciliatory.
BISHOP
Well, that explains it. The
A/2's were always a bit twitchy.
That could never happen now with
out behavioral inhibitors. Impossible
for me to harm or, by omission of
action, allow to be harmed a
human being.
(smiling)
More cornbread?
WHAM! Ripley knocks the plate out of his hand, halfway
across the room.
RIPLEY
Just stay away from me, Bishop!
You got that straight?
Burke and Gorman exchange glances.
Wierzbowski, at the next table, shrugs and turns back
to the other troopers.
WIERZBOWSKI
She don't like the cornbread
either.
INT. READY ROOM - TIGHT ON APONE - ARMORY 33
bellowing.
APONE
Tench-hut!
WIDER ANGLE as the troops snap to from their lounging
among the racks of high-tech weaponry. Gorman enters
with Burke and Ripley.
GORMAN
At ease. I'm sorry we didn't
have time to brief before we
left Gateway but...
HUDSON
Sir?
GORMAN
(annoyed)
Yes, Hicks?
HUDSON
Hudson, Sir. He's Hicks.
GORMAN
What's the question?
HUDSON
Is this going to be a stand-up
fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
GORMAN
All we know is that there's
still no contact with the colony
and that a xenomorph may be
involved.
WIERZBOWSKI
A what?
HICKS
(to Wierzbowski;
low)
It's a bug-hunt.
(louder)
So what are these things?
Gorman nods to Ripley, who stands before the troops.
She sets some RECORDING DISKETTES on the table.
RIPLEY
I've dictated what I know on
these.
APONE
Tease us a bit.
SPUNKMEYER
Yeah...previews.
RIPLEY
Okay. It's important to understand
this organism's life cycle. It's
actually two creatures. The first
form hatches from a spore...a sort
of large egg, and attaches itself
to its victim. Then it injects
an embryo, detaches and dies.
It's essentially a walking sex organ.
The --
HUDSON
Sounds like you, Hicks.
RIPLEY
(controlled)
The embryo, the second form, hosts
in the victim's body for several
hours. Gestating. Then it...
(with difficulty)
...then it...emerges. Moults.
Grows rapidly --
VASQUEZ
I only need to know one thing.
RIPLEY
Yes?
VASQUEZ
Where they are.
Vasquez coolly points her finger, cocks her thumbs, and
blows away an imaginary alien.
DRAKE
Yo! Vasquez. Kick ass!
VASQUEZ
Anytime. Anywhere.
HUDSON
Somebody said alien...she
thought they said illegal alien
and signed up.
VASQUEZ
Fuck you.
HUDSON
Anytime. Anywhere.
RIPLEY
(icy)
Am I disturbing you conversation
Mr. Hudson?
Hudson settles down, smirking. Ripley locks eyes with
Vasquez.
RIPLEY
I hope you're right. I really
do.
BURKE
(to all)
I suggest you study the disks
Ripley has been kind enough to
prepare for you.
GORMAN
Are there any questions? Hudson?
HUDSON
How do I get out of this
chicken-shit outfit?
Gorman scowls then, thanking Ripley with a nod, takes
over the predrop briefing.
GORMAN
All right. I want this to go
smooth and by the numbers. I
want DCS and tactical database
assimilation by 0830.
(some groans)
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
drop-ship prep details will have
seven hours...
EXT. SPACE - ACHERON 34
They have arrived. From orbit the planet looks serene
...Pearlescent cloud cover masking the environmental
torment beneath. The SULACO floats, its MANEUVERING
JETS FIRING. A bluish glow. Then twice more, rapidly.
INT. BRIDGE 35
Bishop is installed in his command seat, hemmed in by
instrumentation.
BISHOP
(into mike)
Attention. This concluded final
maneuvering operations. Thank
you for your cooperation. You
may resume work.
INT. LOADING BAY - TIGHT ON MASSIVE FORKS - CARGO LOCK 34
sliding into a heavy ordnance rack with an echoing
CLANG. PULL BACK as the rack of tactical missiles is
lifted, REVEALING two powerful hydraulic arms.
Spunkmeyer, seated inside a POWER LOADER, swings the
ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the DROP-SHIP where
it locks into place. As he exerts pressure with his
hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms
move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase
in power. The forklift-style CLAWS on each arm can
crush with tons of pressure. The loader has an open
ROLL CAGE to protect the operator, and is supported
by squat HYDRAULIC LEGS which also move correspondingly
with the driver's movements.
You have never seen anything like this before.
Advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift
to them...battered and well used. Covered with grease.
Repainted many times. Across the back is stencilled
""CATERPILLAR.""
Spunkmeyer's machine swings out from under the drop-ship
and we become aware of the intense activity throughout
the cavernous loading bay. Troopers on foot or driving
TOW-MOWERS, OVERHEAD LOADING ARMS...all in motion.
Hicks checks off items on an electronic manifest.
INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY 37
Wierzbowski, Drake and Vasquez are fieldstripping
light weapons with precise movements. Around them,
in racks, is an arsenal of advanced personal
artillery.
Vasquez likes the feel of the guns, the weight...the
authority. Her hands move without hesitation. CLACK.
CLACK. CLACK. She swings one of the SMART-GUNS out
on a work stand. Using a body brace and GYRO-STABILIZED
SUPPORT ARM, it is a computer-aimed, video targeted
automatic weapon. The futuristic equivalent of a .30
caliber light machine gun. Sort of a steadicam that
kills.
INT. LOADING BAY - ANGLE ON BURKE AND GORMAN 38
with pre-flight activity b.g.
BURKE
Still nothing from the colony?
GORMAN
Dead on all channels.
Ripley watches the drop-ship being loaded. A cross
between a Huey Aircobra gunship and the space shuttle
might describe it. An orbit-to-surface troop carrier,
heavily armed for the close support of ground missions.
She watches a six-wheeled APC, ARMORED PERSONNEL
CARRIER, being raised hydraulically into the ship's
belly. Ripley looks around as Frost wheels a rack of
incomprehensible equipment toward her.
FROST
Clear, please.
Ripley jumps aside, nodding apologetically. She turns.
Steps hastily back. Hudson cruises by with a laden
forklift.
HUDSON
Excuse me.
ANGLE ON APONE standing with Hicks, as Ripley approaches
him
RIPLEY
I feel like a fifth wheel
here. Is there anything I can
do?
APONE
I don't know. Is there anything
you can do?
RIPLEY
(pointing)
I can drive that loader. I've
got a Class Two rating. My
latest career move.
Apone turns. A SECOND POWER LOADER sits unused in
an equipment bay.
TWO SHOT APONE AND HICKS skeptical. Considering.
TIGHT ON POWER SWITCH as Ripley's finger punches it on.
A RISING WHINE of power.
TIGHT ON THE HYDRAULICS as the massive machine stirs
to life.
FULL, as the loader starts. Ripley is strapped into
the safety cage, her arms and legs inserted in the
servo-sensor assemblies. She takes a step. BOOM!
Two tons of hardened steel takes a step.
Ripley spins the wrist servos. The huge claws swing,
open...slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a
cargo module, nearby. She raises it deftly.
RIPLEY
Where you want it?
Hicks looks at Apone, cocks an eyebrow appreciatively.
INT. READY ROOM - ARMORY 39
The troopers are suiting up for the drop. Strapping on
their bulky COMBAT-ARMOR...interlocking plates like
football padding. They tape their wrists. Draw on
segmented boots. The sole cleats CLACK like hooves
on the deck plates. Lockers SLAM.
WEB BELTS. PACKS. HARNESSES. HELMETS. COM-SETS.
Their fingers move methodically over the fastenings.
It has its own rhythm...CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.
APONE
Let's move it, girls! On
the ready line. Let's go,
let's go.
INT. DROP-SHIP - APC 40
Ripley, wearing a flight jacket and headset, files into
the ship with the hulking troopers. Inside they pass
directly into the APC we saw loaded earlier and take
seats facing each other across a narrow aisle. They will
drop already strapped into their ground vehicle for
rapid deployment. A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling
depressurization of the cargo lock.
Hudson prowls the aisle, his movements predatory and
exaggerated. Ripley watches him working his way toward
her.
HUDSON
I am ready, man. Ready to get
it on. Check-it-out. I am the
ultimate badass...state of the
badass art. You do not want to
fuck with me. Hey, Ripley, don't
worry. Me and my squad of
ultimate badasses will protect you.
Check-it-out...
He slaps the SERVO-CANNON controls in the GUN BAY
above them.
HUDSON
Independently targetting
particle-beam phalanx. VWAP!
Fry half a city with this puppy.
We got tactical smart-missles,
phased-plasma pulse-rifles,
RPG's. We got sonic eeelectronic
ballbreakers, we got nukes, we
got knives...sharp sticks --
Hicks grabs Hudson by his battle harness and pulls him
into a seat. His voice is low, but it carries.
HICKS
Save it.
HUDSON
Sure, Hicks.
Ripley nods her thanks to Hicks. MOTORS WHINE and the
craft lurches. Burke, next to Ripley, grins eagerly
like this is a sport fishing trip.
BURKE
Here we go.
She looks like she's in a gas chamber waiting for the
pellet to drop.
EXT. SULACO 41
The drop-ship lowers from the cargo-lock on a massive
launch rig. The night side of Acheron yawns below...
enigmatic.
INT. COCKPIT 42
Ferro and Spunkmeyer run rapidly through the switches.
FERRO
Initiate release sequencer on my
mark. Three. Two. One. Mark!
EXT. SULACO - DROP-SHIP 43
Hydraulic WHINE. Clamps SLAM BACK. The ship drops.
INT. DROP-SHIP - APC 44
Apone, stalking the aisle, snatches for a handhold.
Bishop, Burke and Gorman groan at the sudden gees.
Ripley closes her eyes...the point of no return.
EXT. DROP-SHIP 45
It screams down through the stratosphere, plunging
into dark turbulence.
INT. COCKPIT 46
Beyond the canopy is gray limbo. The craft shudders
and lurches.
FERRO
(icy calm)

SPUNKMEYER
Two-four-o. Nominal to profile.
Picking up some hull ionization.
FERRO
Got it. Rough air ahead.
INT. HOLD - APC 47
TIGHT ON HICKS asleep in his harness.
FERRO
(voice over;
filtered)
Stand by for some chop.
TIGHT ON GORMAN as the ship begins to buck, his eyes
closed. Pale. Sweating. He rubs his hands on his
knees repeatedly.
RIPLEY
How may drops is this for you,
Lieutenant?
GORMAN
Thirty-eight...simulated.
VASQUEZ
How many combat drops?
GORMAN
Well...two. Three, including
this one.
Vasquez and Drake exchange do-you-believe-this-shit
expressions. Ripley looks accusingly at Burke.
INT. COCKPIT 48
FERRO
Turning on final. Coming around to
a seven-zero-niner. Terminal
guidance locked in. Where's
the damn beacon?
EXT. DROP-SHIP 49
It emerges from the low cloud ceiling. From the twilight
haze ahead the distant colony LANDING BEACONS become
visible.
INT. HOLD - APC 50
Stumbling as the ship pitches, Ripley makes her way
forward to the MOBILE TACTICAL OPERATIONS BAY (MTOB),
a control console lined with monitor screens. She
joins Burke watching over Gorman's shoulder as the
Lieutenant plays the board like a video director.
TIGHT ON MONITOR CONSOLE REVEALING screens labelled with
the names of the troopers. Two for each soldier. The
upper screens show images from the IMAGE-INTENSIFIED
VIDEO CAMERAS in their helmets. The lower screens are
BIO-MONITORS: EEG, EKG, and other graphic life-function
readouts. Other screens show EXTERIOR VIEWS.
GORMAN
Let's see. Everybody on line.
Drake, check you camera. There
seems to be a...
CLOSE ON DRAKE as he whacks himself on the head with
an ammo case. A familiar malfunction.
GORMAN
(o.s)
...that's better. Pan it around
a bit.
APONE
Awright. Fire-team A. Gear up.
Let's move. Two minutes.
Somebody wake up Hicks.
A clatter of activity as they don backpacks and weapons.
Vasquez and Drake buckle on their smart-gun body
harnesses.
Ripley watches the AP station loom on the exterior
screens.
RIPLEY
That the atmosphere processor?
BURKE
Uh-hunh. One of thirty or so,
all over the planet. They're
completely automated. We
manufacture them, by the way.
EXT. SHIP - AP STATION 51
The tiny ship circles the roaring tower. A metal
volcano thundering like the engines on God's Lear jet.
INT. HOLD - APC 52
Gorman plays with the controls, zooming the image of
the colony.
GORMAN
(to Ferro via mike)
Hold at forty. Slow circle of
the complex.
RIPLEY
The structure seems intact. They
have power.
On the screen the colony buildings loom in and the low
visibility like wrecks of freighters on the sea floor.
GORMAN
(to Apone)
Okay, let's do it.
APONE
Awright! I want a nice clean
dispersal this time.
Ripley turns as Vasquez squeezes past her.
VASQUEZ
You staying in here?
RIPLEY
You bet.
VASQUEZ
(turning away)
Figures.
GORMAN
(to Ferro via mike)
Set down sixty meters this side
of the telemetry mast. Immediate
dust off on my 'clear,' then stay
on station.
APONE
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!
EXT. COLONY COMPLEX 53
Landing beacons sweep harsh light across the wet Tarmac.
The ship roars down, extending the loading ramp. Slams
down on hydraulic LANDING LEGS. The APC hits the ground
a moment later, pulling away from the ship as it leaps
up in a cloud of spray and peels off, circling.
The APC pulls to the edge of the complex. The CREW DOOR
opens. Troopers hit the ground running. Spread out.
They drop behind immediate cover. Apone scans with
him image intensifier visor lowered.
APONE'S P.O.V. through the starlight-scope visor.
Bright as a sunny day, though contrasty and lurid, we
SEE the colony buildings. Trash blows in the street.
No other movement.
GORMAN
(voice over;
filtered)
First squad up, on line. Hicks,
get yours in a cordon. Watch the
rear.
APONE
Vasquez, take point. Let's move.
Sprinting in a skirmish line, Apone's team advances on
the colony main entry-lock. Parked tightly across the
doors are two heavy-duty tractors. Vasquez reaches one
of the tractors, looks inside. The controls are ripped
out, as if by a crowbar or axe. She moves on.
EXT. COLONY BUILDING 54
Vasquez reaches the main doors, Drake flanking on the
right. Apone tries the door controls. Nothing.
APONE
Sealed. Hudson, run a bypass.
Hudson, all business now, moves up and studies the
door control panel. He pries off the facing and starts
clipping on the bypass wires.
APONE
First squad, assemble on me at
the main lock.
The wind roars around the bleak structures. A neon sign
creaks overhead. Hudson makes a connection. The door
shrieks in its tracks and rumbles aside. It jams
partway open. Apone motions Vasquez inside. She
eases over the wrecked tractor, through the doors.
The others follow.
GORMAN
(voice over;
filtered)
Second team, move up.
Flanking positions.
INT. COLONY - MAIN CONCOURSE 55
DOLLYING SLOWLY FORWARD, following Vasquez and Apone as
they move into the broad corridor. A few emergency
lights are still on. Wind moans along the concourse.
Pools of water cover the floor. Farther down, rain drips
through blast holes in the ceiling. Evidence of a
fire fight with pulse-rifles.
ON VASQUEZ moving forward. Taut. Alert. Her smart-gun
cannon swinging slowly in an arc. She studies the
video aiming monitor, looking down rather than ahead.
Their footsteps echo.
INT. APC 56
Ripley watches as the bobbing images reveal the empty
colony building.
GORMAN
Quarter and search by twos. Second
team move inside. Hicks, take the
upper level. Use your motion
trackers.
INT. MAIN CONCOURSE - SECOND LEVEL 57
Hicks leads his squad up the stairwell to second level.
They emerge cautiously. An empty corridor recedes into
the dim distance. Hicks unslings a rugged piece of
equipment. Aims it down the hall. He adjusts the
""gain."" It remains silent.
HICKS
Nothing. No movement.
They pass rooms and offices. Through doors they see
increasing signs of struggle. Furniture overturned.
Papers scattered...floating sodden in the puddles.
INT. APC 58
Ripley et al watching.
BURKE
Looks like my room in college.
Nobody laughs.
INT. SECOND LEVEL 59
Hicks' group passes several burnt-out rooms. There are
no bodies. In several offices the exterior windows are
blown out, admitting wind and rain. Hicks picks up a
half-eaten donut beside a coffee cup overflowing with
rainwater.
INT. LOWER LEVEL - QUARTERS 60
Apone's men are searching systematically in pairs. They
pass through the colonists' modest apartments, little
more than cubicles. Hudson, on tracker, flanks Vasquez
as they move forward. Hudson touches a splash of color
on the wall. Dried blood. His tracker BEEPS.
Vasquez whirls, cannon aimed. The BEEPING grows more
frequent as Hudson advances toward a half open door. The
door is splintered partway out of its frame. Holes
caused by pulse-rifle rounds pepper the walls. Vasquez
eases up to the door. Kicks it in. Tenses to fire.
Inside, dangling from a piece of flex conduit, a
junction-box swings like a pendulum in the wind from a
broken window. It clanks against the rails of a child's
bunkbed as it swings.
INT. DROP-SHIP - APC 61
Ripley watches Hicks' monitor.
RIPLEY
Wait! Tell him to...
(plugs in
headset jack)
...Hicks. Back up. Pan left.
There!
TIGHT ON MONITOR as the image shifts, revealing a
section of wall corroded almost through in an irregular
pattern.
TIGHT ON RIPLEY knowing what it is.
HICKS
(voice over;
filtered)
You seeing this okay? Looks
melted.
Burke raises an eyebrow at Ripley.
BURKE
Hmm. Acid for blood.
HICKS
(voice over;
filtered)
Looks like somebody bagged them
one of Ripley's bad guys here.
INT. FIRST LEVEL 62
Hudson is looking at something.
HUDSON
Hey, if you like that, you're gonna
love this...
WIDER ANGLE showing the trooper standing beneath a
gaping hole. Another hole, directly beneath, is at his
feet. The acid has melted right down through two levels
into the maintenance level. Revealing pipes, conduit,
equipment...eaten away by the ferocious substance.
APONE
Second squad? What's your status?
HICKS
(voice over;
filtered)
Just finished our sweep.
Nobody home.
APONE
(to Gorman)
The place is dead, Sir. Whatever
happened, we missed it.
INT. APC 63
Gorman turns to the others.
GORMAN
All right, the area's secured.
Let's go in and see what their
computer can tell us.
(into mike)
First team head for operations.
Hudson, see if you can get their
CPU on line. Hicks, meet me at
the south lock by the up-link
tower...
INT. FIRST LEVEL 64
GORMAN
(voice over)
...We're coming in.
HUDSON
(cupping his mike)
He's coming in. I feel safer
already.
VASQUEZ
(sotto voice)
Pendejo jerkoff.
EXT. COLONY COMPLEX 65
Lights arc across the dormant buildings as the APC turns
onto the ""main drag."" It trundles down the rutted
street, throwing up sheets of filthy water as the
massive wheels hit pondlike potholes. Windblown rain
lashes across the headlights.
Hicks emerges from the south lock just as the APC rolls
up close to the entrance. The crew-door slides back.
Gorman emerges, followed by Burke, Bishop, and
Wierzbowski. Burke looks back to see Ripley stop in the
APC doorway, eyeing the ominous colony structure. She
meets his eyes. Shakes her head ""no."" Not ready.
HUDSON
(voice over;
filtered)
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
GORMAN
Okay, stand by in operations.
(to those present)
Let's go.
INT. APC 66
The crew-door cycles home with a clang. Ripley sits in
the dark interior, lit by the tactical displays. The
wind howls outside, an incredibly desolate sound. She
hugs herself. Alone. Unarmed. She knows she's in a
tank, but remembers the acid. Leaps up. Hits the door
switch.
EXT. APC - SOUTH LOCK 67
The crew-door opens and Ripley emerges. In time to see
the lock doors rumbling closed.
RIPLEY
(shouting)
Burke!
The wind snatches her words away. The crew door whines
shut behind her. She walks to the exterior lock
door-controls and studies them. She punches some
unfamiliar buttons. Nothing happens. She looks really
nervous, alone in the howling wind. She hits another
button. The door-motors come to life and she relaxes
a little. Glances behind her. AND SCREAMS! There's
a face right there! Right at her shoulder. She jumps
back, gasping for breath.
WIERZBOWSKI
Scare you?
RIPLEY
Christ, Wierzbowski!
WIERZBOWSKI
Sorry. Hicks said to keep an
eye on you.
He gestures for her to precede him inside.
INT. CONTROL BLOCK CORRIDOR 68
Ripley catches up with the others as they move into the
bowels of the complex.
GORMAN
(to Burke)
Looks like you company can write
off its share of this colony.
BURKE
(unconcerned)
It's insured.
ON RIPLEY as they move along the corridor...reacting to
the fact that she is back in alien country. She sees
the ravaged administration complex. Fire-gutted offices.
Hicks notices her looking around nervously. He motions
to big Wierzbowski with his eyes and the trooper casually
falls in beside her on the other side, rifle at ready.
a two-man protective cordon. She glances at Hicks. He
winks, but so fast maybe it's something in his eye.
Trooper Frost emerges from a side corridor ahead.
FRONT
Sir, you should check this out...
He leads the way into the corridor.
INT. CORRIDOR 69
This wing is completely without power. The troopers
switch on their pack lights and the beams illuminate
a scene of devastation worse than they have seen. Her
expression reveals that Ripley is about to turn and flee.
FROST
Right ahead here...
They approach a barricade blocking the corridor, a
hastily welded wall of pipes, steel-plate, outer-door
panels. Acid holes have slashed through the floor and
walls in several places. The metal is scratched and
twisted by hideously powerful forces, peeled back like
a soup can on one side. They squeeze through the
opening.
INT. MEDICAL WING 70
They pack-lights play over the devastation of the
colonists' last ditch battle. The equipment of the med
labs has been uprooted to add to the barrier. The walls
are perforated by pulse-rifle fire and acid. Scorched
by untended fires to bare metal. A few instruments glow
with emergency power.
WIERZBOWSKI
Last stand.
GORMAN
No bodies?
FROST
No, Sir. Looks like it was a
helluva fight.
TIGHT ON RIPLEY transfixed by something.
RIPLEY
(low)
Over there.
The others turn and approach, seeing what she sees. She
has entered a second room, part of the med lab area. In
a storage alcove at near eye level stand seven
transparent cylinders. STASIS TUBES. They glow faintly
with an eerie violet light given off by the field which
preserves the specimens inside.
They look like jars containing SEVERED ARTHRITIC HANDS,
the palsied fingers curled in a death-rictus.
Structurally they are more like spiders with sickening
translucent skin, a flacid scrotal body, gill-like
organs underneath drifting in the suspension fluid.
Something you definitely do not want on your face, for
example.
BURKE
Are these the same...?
Ripley nods, unable to speak. Burke leans closer in
fascination. His face almost touching one cylinder, is
lit by its glow.
RIPLEY
Watch it, Burke...
The creature inside lunges suddenly, slamming against
the glass. Burke jumps back. From the palm of the
thing's handlike body emerges a pearl-escent TUBULE.
like a tapered piece of intestine, which slithers
tonguelike over the inside of the glass. Then it
retracts into a sheath between the ""gills.""
HICKS
(to Burke)
It likes you.
Only two of the creatures seem to pulse with life.
Burke taps the other stasis cylinders but the
hand-things remain inertly clenched.
BURKE
These are dead. There's just
the two alive.
On top of each cylinder is a file folder. Ripley takes
a folder from above one of the live specimens. Inside
is a medical chart printout with handwritten entries.
RIPLEY
(reading)
Removed surgically before embryo
implantation. Subject: Marachuk,
John L. Died during procedure.
(looking up)
They killed him getting it off.
HICKS
Poor bastard.
They are startled by a LOUD BEEP. They turn. Hicks
is intent on his motion tracker, aimed back toward the
shattered barricade. BEEP. BEEP.
HICKS
Behind us.
He gestures at the corridor they just passed through.
RIPLEY
One of us?
GORMAN
(into headset)
Apone...where are your people?
Anybody in D-Block?
APONE
(voice over; filtered)
Negative. We're all in Operations.
Vasquez swings the smart-gun to ready position on
its support arm, locking it with an authoritative
CLICK. She and Hicks head toward the source of the
signal, the others following.
INT. CORRIDOR 71
Hicks' tracker is reading out more rapidly. They
turn into the kitchens, a stainless steel labyrinth.
Ripley hangs back. Then realizes there is nothing
behind her but darkness. She catches up to the group.
INT. KITCHENS 72
The troopers enter, their lights bouncing around the
stainless steel surfaces.
HICKS
It's moving.
Vasquez is scanning, gaze intense. The other troops
grip their weapons tightly.
VASQUEZ
Which way?
Hicks nods toward a complicated array of food
processing equipment. They move forward, weapons
leveled.
Ripley shuffles forward in the dark. Wierzbowski
trips over a metal cannister, sending it CLANGING.
Ripley half climbs the wall.
Hicks' tracker beeps steadily. The beeps merge.
Become a solid tone. CRASH. Something moves in the
dark, toppling a rack of stockpots.
ON VASQUEZ pivoting smoothly to fire. In the same
instant Hicks' rifle slashes INTO FRAME. Slams
Vasquez' barrel upward. A STREAM OF TRACER FIRE rips
into the ceiling, the rounds SEARING LIKE LIGHTNING.
VASQUEZ
You fuck!
Hicks ignores her, moving past and aiming his light
under a row of steel cabinets. He gestures to Ripley,
who steps forward. Trusting his judgment. She
crouches beside him.
RIPLEY'S P.O.V. lit by Hicks' pack-light...a tiny
cowering figure. A very dirty, very terrified
NEWT JORDEN. She clutches a plastic food packet in
one hand, its top gnawed partway through. In the other
hand she grips the HEAD OF A LARGE DOLL, holding it by
the hair. Just the head. Eyes staring. Newt is
pathetically emaciated...fragile-looking as Dresden
china, her hair tangled and matted.
RIPLEY
(soothingly)
Come on out. It's all right...
Ripley moves toward her, reaching slowly under the
cabinet. Newt backs away, trembling visibly, her
vision fixated like a rabbit blinded by headlights.
Ripley's hand almost reaches her.
The kid bolts like a shot, scuttling along beneath the
cabinetry. Ripley scrambles to follow...to keep her
in sight. Crabbing frantically sideways. Hicks makes
a grab, catching one tiny ankle. He snaps his hand
out a moment later.
HICKS
Ow! Shit. Watchit, she bites.
The girl reaches a ventilation duct set in the
baseboard, its grille kicked out. She scrambles
inside, her tiny body barely fitting, wriggling like
a fish.
In his bulky armor Hicks knows he'll never make it
into the tiny duct. Ripley dives. She squirms into
the duct without thinking. Just ahead she sees Newt
enter a dark space and slam a steel hatch. Ripley
pushes the hatch open before the child can latch it,
and crawls in after her.
Newt is backed into a cul-de-sac in the tiny steel
chamber. Ripley shines her light around in amazement.
It is a NEST. A nest built by a child. Wadded up
blankets and pillows line the space, mixed up with a
haphazard array of TOYS, STUFFED ANIMALS, DOLLS, CHEAP
JEWELRY, COMIC BOOKS, EMPTY FOOD PACKETS, even a
battery operated TAPE PLAYER. All foraged from the
wrecked colony. Ripley marvels at the child's
incredible adaptability, the ability to functions even
in this nightmarish environment.
Newt edges along the far wall and dives for the hatch.
Ripley grabs her, controlling her in a bear hug. The
kid struggles wildly, like a cat at the vets. Eyes
wide, hands lashing out in a frenzy...but silent. No
scream.
RIPLEY
It's okay, it's okay. It's over...
you're going to be all right now...
it's okay...you're safe...
Newt goes limp, almost catatonic.
CLOSE ON NEWT'S TRAUMATIZED, VACANT STARE her lips
are white and trembling, her eyes track wildly and
she flinches from unseen terrors. We READ a dark
nightmare world in her eyes.
Ripley's light falls on something amidst the debris...
a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Newt, dressed up and smiling,
a ribbon in her hair. In embossed gold letters
underneath it says:
FIRST GRADE CITIZENSHIP AWARD
REBECCA JORDEN
INT. OPERATIONS - ON NEWT - MANAGER'S OFFICE 73
sitting huddles in a chair, arms around her knees.
Looking at a point in space.
GORMAN
(o.s.)
What's her name again?
DIETRICH
(o.s.)
Rebecca.
WIDER ANGLE REVEALING Gorman sitting in front of her
while Dietrich watches the readouts from a
BIO-MONITORING CUFF wrapped around Newt's tiny arm.
GORMAN
Now think, Rebecca.
Concentrate. Just start at
the beginning...
No response. Ripley enters, carrying a coffee mug.
GORMAN
Where are your parents? You
have to try...
RIPLEY
(sharply)
Gorman! Give it a rest would
you.
Gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal.
GORMAN
Total brain-lock.
DIETRICH
(shrugs)
Physically she's okay.
Borderline malnutrition, but
I don't think any permanent
damage.
She unsnaps the bio-monitoring cuff.
GORMAN
Come on, we're wasting our
time.
Gorman and the others exit, leaving only Ripley with
Newt. Through the window of the office, out on the
main floor of the operations room, we SEE Gorman
join Burke and Bishop at a computer terminal.
Ripley kneels beside Newt, brushing the girl's unkempt
hair out of her eyes in a gentle, maternal fashion.
RIPLEY
Here, try this. A little
instant hot chocolate.
She wraps the child's hands around the cup. Raises
it to her lips for her. The girl drinks mechanically,
spilling down her chin.
RIPLEY
(soothing)
Poor thing. You don't talk
much do you? That's okay by
me. Most people do a lot of
talking and they wind up not
saying very much.
She sets the cup down and wipes the child's chin clean.
RIPLEY
Uh oh. I made a clean spot
here. Now I've done it. Guess
I'll just have to do the whole
thing.
She pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small
cloth and gently washes the little girl's face.
Newt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time.
RIPLEY
Hard to believe...there's a
little girl under all this.
And a pretty one at that.
Newt gazes at her. Ripley smiles.
INT. OPERATIONS 74
The ground teams are gathered around a terminal in
the computer center. Hudson has the CPU main computer
on-line and reading out.
TIGHT ON MONITOR SCREEN as an abstract of the main
colony ground plan drifts across the screen.
Searching.
Hudson bashes at the keyboard, his fingers dancing
expertly.
BURKE
(to Gorman)
What's he scanning for?
GORMAN
PDT'S. Personal-Data Transmitters.
Every adult colonist had one
surgically implanted.
HUDSON
If they're within twenty
klicks we'll read it out here,
but so far...zip.
INT. OFFICE 75
Ripley is washing Newt's tiny hands with a cloth,
pink skin emerging from black grime.
RIPLEY
I don't know how you managed
to stay alive but you're one
brave kid, Rebecca.
Newt's voice is almost inaudible.
NEWT
N-newt.
Ripley leans closer. Feels like she's breathing
on coals. The sound was incomprehensible.
RIPLEY
What did you say?
NEWT
Newt. My n-name's Newt.
Nobody calls me Rebecca except
my dork brother.
Ripley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak...
or break the spell.
RIPLEY
Well, Newt it is then. My
name's Ripley...and people
call me Ripley.
Ripley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking it
formally.
RIPLEY
Pleased to meet you. And who
is this? Does she have a
name?
Newt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutched
in one filthy hand.
NEWT
Casey. She's my only friend.
RIPLEY
What about me?
Newt's reply is flat, neutral.
NEWT
I don't want you for a friend.
RIPLEY
Why not?
NEWT
Because you'll be gone soon,
like the others. Like
everybody. You'll be dead
and you'll leave me alone.
Ripley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominous
statement and by the situation which could have
produced this outlook in a child.
RIPLEY
Oh, Newt. You mom and dad
went away like that, didn't
they?
Newt nods, staring at her knees.
RIPLEY
(soothingly)
They'd be here if they could,
honey. I know they would.
NEWT
(with cold certainty)
They're dead.
RIPLEY
Newt. Look at me...Newt. I
won't leave you. I promise.
NEWT
You promise?
RIPLEY
Cross my heart.
NEWT
And hope to die?
Ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabre
expression.
RIPLEY
(quietly)
And hope to die.
And because she's a child, the darkest terrors, even
the ones seen and not imagined, can still be banished
by a smile and a single promise.
Newt's eyes brim as she gazes at Ripley. Her lower
lip starts to tremble, and her face slowly deforms
into an abject mask. She sobs as she clamps her arms
around Ripley's neck. The sobs come in waves as
Ripley rocks her, tears of suppresses terror and
grief and hurt rolling down her face. It is a
breakthrough.
Ripley closes her eyes, hoping that this promise
can be kept.
INT. OPERATIONS 76
Everyone jumps as Hudson cries out triumphantly.
HUDSON
Hah! Stop your grinnin' and
drop your linen! Found 'em.
GORMAN
Alive?
HUDSON
Unknown. But, it looks like
all of them. Over at the
processing station...sublevel
'C' under the south tower.
TIGHT ON SCREEN showing an amoebalike cluster of
flashing blue dots clumped tightly in one area.
HICKS
Looks like a Goddamn town
meeting.
GORMAN
Let's saddle up.
APONE
Awright, let's go girls, they
ain't payin' us by the hour.
EXT. ACHERON - TWILIGHT 77
The APC roars across the stygian landscape, traversing
the causeway which connects the colony to the
ATMOSPHERE STATION a kilometer away. Behind it the
drop-ship settles to the ground at the colony landing
field.
PAN WITH THE APC TO REVEAL the massive structure.
Like a vast foundry the conical exhaust tower
flickers with spectral light.
INT. APC 78
The troopers sit, more subdued now, swaying and
bouncing in the heavily sprung vehicle. Wierzbowski
is in the saddle. Ripley and Newt sit side by side
just aft of the driver's cockpit.
NEWT
I was the best at the game.
I knew the whole maze.
RIPLEY
The 'maze'? You mean the
air ducts?
NEWT
Yeah, you know. In the walls,
under the floor. I was the
ace. I could hide better
than anybody.
RIPLEY
You're really something, ace.
Ripley's gaze shifts out the windshield as the
processing station looms ahead.
EXT. APC/STATION 79
The vast structure towers above the parked personnel
carrier. Deploying in front of the APC, backlit by
its lights, the troopers cast long shadows. They
look ominous. Hulking techno-samurai.
The base of the station is a depthless maze of
conduits and pressure vessels, like an oil refinery.
Or a Dantean version of one. The THRUM of
functioning machine systems echoes through the
labyrinth.
GORMAN
(voice over; static)
Forty meters in. Ramp on
axial two-two. Access to
sublevels.
The troopers start down the open rampway. Light
filters down through several levels of steel mesh
floor, catwalks and pipes. Below that is darkness.
GORMAN
(voice over; static)
B-Level. Next one down.
The thrumming of machines grows louder as they
descend.
INT. APC 80
Huddles around the screens are Ripley, Burke and
Gorman. Newt squeezes in from behind. Gorman is
doing his video wizard bit, dancing on the buttons.
GORMAN
(to team)
We're not making that out too
well. What is it?
HUDSON
(voice over; static)
You tell me. I only work
here.
INT. COMPLEX 81
The group stands before a bizarre tableau. Among
the refinerylike lattice of pipes and conduits
something new and not of human design had been
added.
It is a structure of some sort, extending from and
crudely imitating the complex of plumbing, but made
of some strange encrusted substance. It vaguely
resembles the chambered nests of swallows on a much
larger scale, and it attenuates so gradually into
the original hardware that it is hard to see where
one ends and the other begins.
The alien structure seems to extend far back into
the complex of machinery. The plant thrums loudly,
its functioning seemingly not impaired.
INT. APC 82
Ripley stares at the scene in dread fascination.
GORMAN
What is it?
RIPLEY
I don't know.
GORMAN
(to team)
Proceed inside.
INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE 83
They enter the organic labyrinth, playing their
lights over the walls. Revealing a BIO-MECHANICAL
LATTICE, like the marrow of some vast bone. The air
is thick with STEAM. Trickling water. The place
seems almost alive.
INT. APC 84
They watch in various helmet-camera P.O.V.'s of the
wall detail.
RIPLEY
(low)
Oh God...
CLOSE ON VIDEO as it PAN SLOWLY...REVEALING a
bas-relief of detritus from the colony: furniture,
wiring, human bones, skulls...Fused together with a
translucent, epoxylike substance.
DIETRICH
(voice over; static)
Looks like some sort of secreted
resin.
GORMAN
They ripped apart the colony
for building materials.
RIPLEY
And the colonists...When they
were done with them.
(turning)
Newt, you better go sit up
front. Go on.
INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE 85
Steam swirls around them as the troopers move deeper
inside.
FROST
Hotter'n hell in here.
HUDSON
Yeah...but it's a dry
heat.
INT. APC 86
Ripley leans forward suddenly, studying the graphic
readout of the STATION GROUND PLAN.
RIPLEY
They're right under the
primary heat exchangers.
BURKE
Yeah? Maybe the organisms like
the heat, that's why they built...
RIPLEY
That's not what I mean. Gorman,
if your men have to use their
weapons in there, they'll rupture
the cooling system.
BURKE
(realizing)
She's right.
GORMAN
So.
RIPLEY
So...then the fusion
containment shuts down.
GORMAN
(impatient)
So? So?
BURKE
We're talking thermonuclear
explosion.
GORMAN
Shit.
(into
mike)
Apone, collect magazines
from everybody. We can't
have any firing in there.
INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE 87
The troopers look at each other in dismay.
WIERZBOWSKI
Is he fucking crazy?
HUDSON
What're we supposed to use,
man? Harsh language?
GORMAN
(voice over; static)
Flame-units only. I want
rifles slung.
APONE
Let's go. Pull 'em out.
He walks among the troopers, collecting the magazines
from each one's weapon.
Vasquez turns hers over reluctantly.
The three who are carrying them get out small
incinerator units. When Apone moves on, Vasquez
slips a spare magazine from concealment and inserts
it in her weapon. Drake does the same. Hicks hangs
back in the shadows. He opens a cylindrical sheath
attached to his battle-harness. Slides out an
old style PUMP TWELVE-GAUGE with a sawed-off butt
stock. Chambers a round.
HICKS
(low,
to Hudson)
I always keep this handy.
For close encounter.
APONE
(o.s.)
Let's move. Hicks, back
us up.
INT. LARGER CHAMBER 88
The air is thick. Lights flare.
GORMAN
(voice over;
very faint)
Any movement?
Hudson watches his tracker, scanning.
HUDSON
Nothing. Zip.
Apone stops, his expression changing. They face a
wall of living horror. The colonists have been
brought here and entombed alive...
COCOONS protrude from the niches and interstices
of the structure. The cocoon material is the same
translucent epoxy. The bodies are frozen in
carelessly twisted positions. Macabre image of
frozen agony. Many are disiccated. Skeletal.
Rip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within.
Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death
as hosts for the embryos growing within then.
Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures,
perhaps the most ""recent."" A WOMAN, ghost-white
and drained. The WOMAN'S EYES SNAP OPEN...They
seem to plead.
DIETRICH
Sir!
The woman's lips move feebly.
WOMAN
Please...God...kill me.
INT. APC 89
Ripley watches the woman, white knuckled. The
sound of RETCHING comes over the general frequency.
INT. COCOON CHAMBER 90
The woman begins to convulse. She SCREAMS, a
sawing shriek of mindless agony.
APONE
Flame thrower! Move!
Frost hands it to him. Suddenly, the woman's chest
EXPLODES in a gout of blood. A SMALL FANGED HEAD
EMERGES, HISSING VICIOUSLY.
Apone pulls the trigger. Then the other troopers
carrying flame throwers open fire. An orgy of
purging fire. The cocoons vanish in the shimmering
heat.
A SHRILL SCREECHING begins, like a siren made from
fingernails on blackboards.
ANGLE ON WALL as something begins to emerge. Dimly
glimpsed, a glistening bio-mechanoid creature larger
then a man. Lying dormant, it had blended perfectly
with the convoluted surface of fused bone. The
troopers don't see it. Smoke from the burning cocoons
quickly fills the confined space. Visibility drops
to zero.
HUDSON
Movement!
APONE
Position?
HUDSON
Can't lock up...
APONE
(with an edge)
Talk to me, Hudson.
HUDSON
Uh, seems to be in front
and behind.
INT. APC 91
Gorman is plating with the gain controls on the
monitors.
GORMAN
We can't see anything back
here, Apone. What's going on?
Ripley senses it coming, like a wave at night. Dark,
terrifying and inevitable.
RIPLEY
(low)
Pull you team out, Gorman.
INT. COCOON CHAMBER - TIGHT ON SEVERAL WALLS AND 92
CEILING NICHES
as they come alive. Bonelike, tubelike shapes shift,
becoming emerging ALIENS. Dimly glimpsed...glints
of slime. Silhouettes.
APONE
Go to infrared. Looks sharp
people!
The squad members snap down their image-intersifier
visors.
HUDSON
Multiple signals. All round.
Closing.
Dietrich turns to retreat, her flamethrower held
tightly. A nightmarish silhouette materializes out
of the smoke behind her! It strikes like lightning.
SEIZES HER. She fires reflexively, wild. The jet
of flame engulfs Frost nearby.
Apone spins as the double SCREAM. Can't see anything
in the think smoke.
INT. APC 93
Ripley watches Frost's monitor go black. His
bio-readouts flatten. The other screens show glimpses
of shimmering infrared silhouettes of the aliens, the
images bobbing and panning confusedly.
INT. COCOON CHAMBER 94
Vasquez nods to Drake with grim satisfaction.
VASQUEZ
Let's rock.
They OPEN UP simultaneously, lighting up the smoke
like welders' arcs.
GORMAN
(voice over; static)
Who's firing? I ordered a
hold fire, dammit!
Vasquez rips off her headset. She is riveted to the
targetting screen, moving ferret-quick in a pivoting
dance. Thunder and lightning. Better than sex for
her. FLASH-CRACK! An alien SCREECH from the darkness.
INT. APC 95
The battle of phantoms unfolds on the video screens.
Ripley flinches as another scream comes over the
open frequency. Wierzbowski's monitor breaks up.
His life signs plummet. Voices blend and overlap.
HUDSON
(voice over)
Let's get the fuck out of
here!
HICKS
(voice over)
Not that tunnel, the other
one!
CROWE
(voice over)
You sure? Watch it...behind
you. Fucking move, will you!
Gorman is ashen. Confused. Gulping for air like a
grouper. How could the situation have unravelled
so fast?
RIPLEY
(to Gorman)
GET THEM OUT OF THERE! DO
IT NOW!
GORMAN
Shut up. Just shut up!
CRASH! Crowe's telemetry cuts off like the plug was
pulled. Flat line.
GORMAN
Uh,...Apone, I want you to
lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators and
fall back by squads to the
APC, over.
APONE
(voice over;
heavy static)
Say again? All after
incinerators?
Ripley watches it fall apart.
GORMAN
I said...
INT. COCOON CHAMBER 96
Apone adjusts his headset.
GORMAN
(voice over;
static)
...lay down (garbled) ...by
squads to...(garbled)
Gorman's voice breaks up completely. A SCREAM.
Apone whirls, uncertain.
APONE
Dietrich? Crowe? Sound
off! Wierzbowski?
Nothing. He spins. Almost blows Hudson's head
off.
HUDSON
(freaked)
We're getting juked! We're
gonna die in here!
Apone hands him a magazine. Hudson slaps it home,
looking truly terrified.
APONE
Yeah. Right. Right! Fuck
the heat exchanger!
He FIRES. Vasquez, nearby, is laying down a
horrendous field of fire. Strobe-bright flashes
sear the darkness. She pivots, firing mechanically
in controlled bursts. Scoring points in her own
private video game.
She SPINS as Hicks approached laterally. WHAM! She
fires ""at"" him. Hicks whirls...to see a nightmarish
figure right behind him, catapulted backwards by
Vasquez' blast.
INT. APC 97
Apone's monitor SPINS CRAZILY AND GOES DARK.
GORMAN
(distantly)
I told them to fall back...
RIPLEY
(viciously)
They're but off! Do something!
But he's gone. Total brain-lock.
TIGHT ON RIPLEY as she struggles with a decision.
She's terrified...of what she knows she's about to
do. But more than that, she's furious. Shouldering
past a paralyzed Gorman she runs up the aisle of the
APC.
RIPLEY
(in passing)
Newt, put your seatbelt on!
Ripley jumps into the driver's seat of the APC. Takes
a deep breath. Starts slapping switches.
GORMAN
Ripley, what the hell...?
She slams the tractor into gear.
EXT. APC 98
as the drive-wheels spin on the wet ground. The
massive machine leaps forward.
INT. APC 99
Ripley sees smoke pouring out of the complex ahead
as she slides sideways onto the descending rampway.
She slams the left and right drive-wheel actuators
viciously, spinning the machine in a roaring pivot.
Gorman lunges forward along the aisle, abandoning
his command center.
GORMAN
(shrill)
What are you doing? Turn
around! That's an order!
He claws at her, hysterical. Burke pulls him off.
INT. ALIEN STRUCTURE 100
The APC roars down into the smoky structure, tearing
away outcroppings of alien-encrustation. Ripley hits
the floodlights. Strobe-beacon. Siren. She homes
on the flash of weapons fire ahead.
INT. COCOON CHAMBER 101
The APC crashes inside, showering debris. Hicks,
supporting a limping Hudson, appears out of the smoke.
The APC pulls up broadside and Burke gets the crew-door
open.
Drake and Vasquez back out of the dense mist, firing as
they fall back.
Drake goes empty, slams the buckles cutting loose his
smart-gun harness, and unslings a flame thrower.
Hicks pushes Hudson inside, leaps in after him and
drags Vasquez inside, massive gear and all. She sees
a DARK SHAPE lunge toward Drake. She fires one burst,
prone. Clean body hit.
The flash lights up the hideous inhuman grin, blowing
open the thing's thorax. A spray of BRIGHT YELLOW
ACID slashes across Drake's face and chest, eating
into him like a hot knife through butter. He drops
in boiling smoke, reflexively triggering his flame
thrower.
The jet of liquid fire arcs around as he falls,
engulfing the back half of the APC.
INT. APC 102
Vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots
through the crew-door, setting the interior on fire.
Hicks is rolling the door closed when Vasquez lunges,
clawing out the opening. He stops her, dragging her
inside.
VASQUEZ
Drake! He's down!
Hicks screams right in her face.
HICKS
He's gone! Forget it, he's
gone!
VASQUEZ
(irrational)
No.. No, he's not. He's --
Burke and Hudson help him drag her from the door.
HICKS
(to Ripley)
Let's go!
Ripley jams reverse. Nails the throttle. The APC
bellows backward up the ramp. Hudson disappears
under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks
free. Hicks gets the door almost closed. Suddenly
CLAWS appear at the edge. Newt screams. Against
the combined efforts of Hicks, Burke and Vasquez
the door is being SLOWLY WRENCHED OPEN FROM OUTSIDE.
Hicks yells at a paralyzed Gorman.
HICKS
Get on the Goddamn door!
Gorman backs away, eyes wide. Hicks jams his shoulder
against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise
his 12-gauge. An alien head wedges through the opening,
its hideous mouth opening. And Hicks jams his SHOTGUN
MUZZLE between its jaws and pulls the trigger! BLAM!
The creature is flung backward, its shattered head
fountaining acid blood. The spray eats into the door,
the deck, hits Hudson on the arm. He shrieks. They
slide the door home and dog it tight.
EXT. APC 103
The armored vehicle roars backward up the ramp. Slams
into a mass of conduit. Tears free. Ripley works the
shifters, pivoting the massive machine. Everybody's
shouting, trying to put out the fire. Pandemonium.
INT./EXT. APC 104-
105
Something lands on the roof with a metallic clang.
Gorman has plastered himself against a wall, as far
from the door as possible. A latch lever behind his
head turns. The small hatch against which he was
leaning is ripped away and SOMETHING snatches him out
the opening He disappears to the waist with a shriek,
legs kicking. The alien clings to the roof, pulling
him out. Its tail whips over, scorpionlike, and
buries a four inch stinger in Gorman's shoulder.
Hicks grabs a joy stick at the FIRE-CONTROL CONSOLE
and turns it rapidly. On the roof the alien looks up
as servo-motors whir. A remote control turret cannon,
a 20mm chain-gun, swivels toward it in a curt arc.
VOOM. The creature is blasted off the vehicle's
armored back and tumbles away. Gorman, slumped
unconscious, is dragged back inside.
The APC rips away a section of catwalk and heads for
clear air, its flank trailing fire like a comet.
Ripley fights the controls as the big machine slews,
broadsiding a control-room out-building. Office
furniture and splintered wall sections are strewn in
the APC's wake.
Suddenly, an alien arm arcs down, right in front of
Ripley's face. It smashes the windshield. Glistening,
hideous jaws lunge inside...
Ripley recoils. Face to face once again with the same
mind-numbing horror. She reacts instinctively. Slams
both sets of brakes with all her strength. The huge
wheels lock. The creature flips off, landing in the
headlights. Ripley hits full throttle. The APC roars
forward, smashing over the abomination. Its skeletal
body is crushed under the massive wheels. It rolls,
tumbling...lost in the darkness behind as the machine
thunders onto the causeway and away from the station.
A sound like bolts dropped in a meat grinder is coming
from the APC's rear end. Hicks eases Ripley's hand
back on the throttle lever. Her grip is white knuckled.
HICKS
It's okay...we're clear. We're
clear. Ease up.
The grinding clatter becomes deafening even as she
slows the machine.
HICKS
Sounds like a blown transaxle.
You're just grinding metal.
EXT. APC 106
The tractor limps to a halt. A HALF-KILOMETER from the
atmosphere processing station. The APC is a smoking,
acid-scarred mess.
INT. APC 107
Ripley, still running on the adrenalin dynamo, spins
out of her seat into the aisle.
RIPLEY
Newt? Where's Newt?
Feeling a tug at her pants leg she looks down. Newt
is wedged into a tiny space between the driver's seat
and a bulkhead. She is trembling, and looks terrified,
but it's not the basket case catatonia of before.
RIPLEY
You okay?
Newt gives her a THUMBS-UP, wan but stoic. Ripley goes
back to the others. Hudson is holding his arm and
staring in stunned dismay at nothing, playing it all
back in his mind.
HUDSON
Jesus...Jesus...I don't believe
it.
Burke tries to have a look at Hudson's arm.
HUDSON
(jerking away)
I'm all right, leave it!
Ripley joins Hicks who is bent over Gorman, checking
for a pulse.
HICKS
He's alive. I think he's paralyzed.
VASQUEZ
He's fucking dead!
She grabs Gorman by the collar, hauling him up roughly,
ready to pulp him with her other fist.
VASQUEZ
(to Gorman)
Wake up pendejo! I'm gonna kill
you, you useless fuck!
Hicks pushes her back. Right in her face.
HICKS
Hold it. Hold it. Back off, right
now.
Vasquez releases Gorman. His head smacks the deck.
Ripley opens Gorman's tunic, revealing a bloodless
purple puncture wound.
RIPLEY
Looks like it stung him.
HUDSON
Hey...hey! Look, Crowe and
Dietrich aren't dead, man.
They turn to see Hudson at the MTOB monitors, pointing
at the bio-function screens.
HUDSON
They must be like Gorman. Their
signs are real low but they ain't
dead!
Hudson is pale, panicky, and his voice echoes around
the tiny metallic space and comes back to all of them
as the near hysteria they all feel, fluttering just
at the edges of their minds.
RIPLEY
You can't help them. Right now
they're being cocooned just like
the others.
HUDSON
(sagging)
Oh, God. Jesus. This ain't
happening.
Ripley and Vasquez lock eyes. Ripley doesn't want
it to be ""I told you so"" but Vasquez reads it that
way. She turns away with a snap.
INT. MED LAB 108
Bishop is hunched over an occular probe doing a
dissection of one of the dead parasites. Spunkmeyer
enters with some electronics gear on a hand truck
and parks it near Bishop's work table.
SPUNKMEYER
Need anything else?
Bishop waves ""no"" without looking up.
EXT. COLONY - DROP-SHIP 109
Spunkmeyer emerges, crossing the Tarmac to the loading
ramp of the ship. As he nears the top of the ramp,
his boot slips...skidding on something wet. Kneeling,
he touches a small puddle of thick slime. He shrugs,
and hits the controls to retract the ramp and close
the doors.
INT. APC 110
ON VASQUEZ wired and intense.
VASQUEZ
All right, we can't blow the fuck
out of them...why not roll some
canisters of CN-20 down there.
Nerve gas the whole nest?
HUDSON
Look, man, let's just bug out and
call it even, okay?
RIPLEY
(to Vasquez)
No good. How do we know it'll
effect their biochemistry? I say
we take off and nuke the entire
site from orbit. It's the only
way to be sure.
BURKE
Now hold on a second. I'm not
authorizing that action.
RIPLEY
Why not?
Burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals
flawlessly into conciliatory mode.
BURKE
Well, I mean...I know this is an
emotional moment, but let's not
make snap judgments. Let's move
cautiously. First, this physical
installation had a substantial
dollar value attached to it --
RIPLEY
They can bill me. I got a tab
running. What's second?
BURKE
This is clearly an important
species we're dealing with here.
We can't just arbitrarily
exterminate them --
RIPLEY
Bullshit!
VASQUEZ
Yeah, bullshit. Watch us.
HUDSON
Maybe you haven't been keeping up
on current events, but we just got
out asses kicked, pal!
Ripley faces Burke squarely and she's not pleased.
RIPLEY
Look, Burke. We had an agreement.
Burke moves in, lowering his voice. He takes her aside
from the others.
BURKE
I know, I know, but we're dealing
with changing scenarios here. This
thing is major, Ripley. I mean
really major. You gotta go with
its energy. Since you are the
representative of the company who
discovered this species your
percentage will naturally be
some serious, serious money.
Ripley stares at his like he's a particularly
disagreeable fungus.
RIPLEY
You son of a bitch.
BURKE
(hardening)
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
RIPLEY
What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.
BURKE
Corporal Hicks!?
RIPLEY
This operation is under military
jurisdiction and Hicks is next in
chain of command. Right?
HICKS
Looks that way.
Burke starts to lose it and it's not a pretty sight.
BURKE
Look, this is a multimillion
dollar operation. He can't make
that kind of decision. He's just
a grunt!
(glances at Hicks)
No offense.
HICKS
(coolly)
None taken.
(into mike)
Ferro, you copying?
FERRO
(voice over; static)
Standing by.
HICKS
Prep for dust-off. We're gonna
need an immediate evac.
(to Burke)
I think we'll take off and nuke
the site from orbit. It's the
only way to be sure.
He winks. Burke looks like a kid whose toy has been
snatched.
BURKE
This is absurd! You don't have
the authority to --
CLACK! The sound of a rifle bolt snapping home
truncates his rant. Vasquez has a pulse-rifle cradled,
not exactly aimed at Burke but not exactly aimed away
either. Her expression is masklike. End of discussion.
Ripley sits behind Newt, putting her arm around her.
RIPLEY
We're going home, honey.
EXT. DROP-SHIP 111
The ship rises through the spray thrown up by the
downblast of the VTOL jets, hovering above the complex
like a huge insect, its searchlights blazing.
EXT. APC 112
The group is filing out of the personnel carrier, which
is clearly a write off. Hicks and Hudson have Gorman
between them, and the others emerge into the wind.
They watch the ship roar in on its final approach.
INT. DROP-SHOP COCKPIT 113
Ferro flicks the intercom switch several times. Thumps
her headset mike.
FERRO
Spunkmeyer? Goddammit.
The compartment door behind her slides slowly back.
FERRO
(turning)
Where the fu --
Her eyes widen. It's not Spunkmeyer.
Am impression of leering jaws which blur forward, then
a whirl of motion and a truncated scream. The throttle
levers are slammed forward in the melee.
EXT. APC - LANDSCAPE - STATION 114
They watch in dismay as the approaching ship dips and
VEERS WILDLY. Its main engines ROAR FULL ON and the
craft accelerates toward them even as it loses altitude.
It skims the ground. Clips a rock formation. The
ship slews, sideslipping. It hits a ridge. Tumbles,
bursting into flame, breaking up. It arcs into the
air, end over end, a Catherine wheel juggernaut.
RIPLEY
Run!
She grabs Newt and sprints for cover as a tumbling
section of the ship's massive engine module slams
into the APC and it explodes into twisted wreckage.
The drop-ship skips again, like a stone, engulfed in
flames...AND CRASHES INTO THE STATION. A TREMENDOUS
FIREBALL.
The remainder of the ground team watches their hopes
of getting off the planet, and most of their superior
fire power, reduced to flaming debris.
There is a moment of stunned silence, then...
HUDSON
(hysterical)
Well that's great! That's just
fucking great, man. Now what the
fuck are we supposed to do, man?
We're in some real pretty shit now!
HICKS
Are you finished?
(to Ripley)
You okay?
She nods. She can't disguise her stricken expression
when she looks at Newt, but the little girl seems
relatively calm. She shrugs with fatalistic acceptance.
NEWT
I guess we're not leaving, right?
RIPLEY
I'm sorry, Newt.
NEWT
You don't have to be sorry. It
wasn't your fault.
HUDSON
(kicking rocks)
Just tell me what the fuck we're
supposed to do now. What're we
gonna do now?
BURKE
(annoyed)
May be could build a fire and
sing songs.
NEWT
We should get back, 'cause it'll
be dark soon. They come mostly
at night. Mostly.
Ripley follows Newt's look to the AP station looming
in the twilight, the burning drop-ship wreckage jammed
into its basal structure.
EXT. CONTROL BLOCK - NIGHT 115
The wind howls mournfully around the metal buildings,
dry and cold.
INT. OPERATIONS 116
The weary and demoralized group is gathered to take
stock of their grim options. Vasquez and Hudson are
just setting down a scorched and dented packing case,
one of several culled from the APC wreckage.
Hicks indicates their remaining inventory of weapons,
lying on a table.
HICKS
This is all we could salvage. We've
got four pulse-rifles with about
fifty rounds each. Not so good.
About fifteen M-40 grenades and
two flame throwers less than
half full...one damaged. And
We've got four of these
robot-sentry units with scanners
and display intact.
He opens one of the scorched cases, revealing a
high-tech servo-actuated machine gun with optical
sensing equipment, packed in foam.
RIPLEY
How long after we're declared
overdue can we expect a rescue?
HICKS
About seventeen days.
HUDSON
Man, we're not going to make it
seventeen hours! Those things
are going to come in here, just
like they did before, man...
they're going to come in here
and get us, man, long before...
RIPLEY
She survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training.
Ripley indicates Newt, who salutes Hudson smartly.
RIPLEY
So you better just start dealing
with it. Just deal with it,
Hudson...because we need you and
I'm tired of your bullshit. Now
get on a terminal and call up some
kind of floor plan file.
Construction blueprints,
maintenance schematics, anything
that shows the layout of this
place. I want to see air ducts,
electrical access tunnels,
subbasements. Every possible way
into this wing.
Hudson gathers himself, thankful for the direction.
Hicks nods approval of her handling of it.
HUDSON
Aye-firmative. I'm on it.
BISHOP
I'll be in medical. I'd like to
continue my analysis.
RIPLEY
Fine. You do that.
INT. OPERATIONS 117
Burke, Ripley, Hudson and Hicks are bent over a large
HORIZONTAL VIDEOSCREEN, like an illuminated chart table.
Newt hops from one foot to the other to see.
RIPLEY
This service tunnel is how they're
moving back and forth.
HUDSON
Yeah, right, it runs from the
processing station right into
the sublevel here.
He traces a finger along the abstract ground plan.
RIPLEY
All right. There's a fire door
at this end. The first thing we
do is put a remote sentry in the
tunnel and seal that door.
HICKS
We gotta figure on them getting
into the complex.
RIPLEY
That's right. So we put up
welded barricades at these
intersections...
(pointing)
...and seal these ducts here
and here. Then they can only
come at us from these two
corridors and we create a free
field of fire for the other
two sentry units, here.
Hicks contemplates her game plan and raises his hand,
satisfied.
HICKS
Outstanding. Then all we need's
a deck of cards. All right, let's
move like we got a purpose.
HUDSON
Aye-firmative.
NEWT
(imitating Hudson)
Aye-firmative!
INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - SUBLEVEL 118
A long straight service tunnel, lined with conduit,
seems to go on forever. Vasquez and Hudson have
finished setting up two of the robot sentry guns on
tripods in the tunnel.
VASQUEZ
(shouting)
Testing!
She hurls a wastebasket down the tunnel, into the
automatic field of fire. The sentry guns swivel
smoothly, the wastebasket bounces once...and is riddled
by two quick bursts of EXPLODING 10MM ROUNDS into
dime-sized shrapnel. They retreat behind a heavy steel
FIRE DOOR which they roll closed on its track. Vasquez,
using a PORTABLE WELDING TORCH, begins sealing the door
to its frame, as Hudson paces nervously.
HUDSON
Hudson here. A and B
sentries are in place and
keyed. We're sealing the
tunnel.
INT. SECOND LEVEL CORRIDOR 119
Hicks pauses in his work.
HICKS
(into mike)
Roger.
He and Ripley are covering an air duct opening with
a metal plate, welding it in place, showering sparks
in the dark corridor. Behind them Burke and Newt
are moving back and forth with cartons of food on a
hand truck, stacking it inside the operations center.
Hicks sets down his welder and pulls a small object
out of a belt pouch. A braceletlike EMERGENCY
LOCATING BEEPER.
HICKS
Here, put this on. Then
I can locate you anywhere
in the complex on this --
He indicates a tiny TRACKER hooked to his battle
harness. He shrugs, a little self-consciously.
HICKS
Just a...precaution. You
know.
Ripley pauses for a moment, regarding him
quizzically.
RIPLEY
(strapping
it on)
Thanks.
HUDSON
Uh, what's next?
She consults a printout of the floor plan.
EXT. CONTROL BLOCK 120
The wind has died utterly and in the even more eerie
stillness a diffuse mist has rolled into shroud
the complex. Visibility is low in the fog.
Everything looks underwater. There is no movement.
INT. CORRIDOR 121
In the barricaded corridor sentry-gun ""C"" sits waiting,
its ""ARMED"" light flashing green. Through a hole
torn in the ceiling at the far end of the corridor
the fog swirls in. Water drips. An expectant hush.
INT. MED LAB ANNEX - OPERATING ROOM 122
Ripley carries an exhausted Newt through the inner
connecting rooms of the medical wing. She reaches
an OPERATING ROOM which is small but very high-tech
...vaultlike metal walls, strange equipment.
Several metal cots have been set up, displacing O.R.
equipment which is pushed into one corner.
Newt is resting her head on Ripley's shoulder, barely
awake...out of steam. Ripley sets her on one of
the cots and Newt lies down.
RIPLEY
Now you just lie here and
have a nap. You're exhausted.
NEWT
I don't want to...I have
scary dreams.
This obviously strikes a chord with Ripley, but she
feigns cheerfulness.
RIPLEY
I'll bet Casey doesn't have
bad dreams.
Ripley lifts the doll's head from Newt's tiny fingers
and looks inside. It is, of course, empty.
RIPLEY
Nothing bad in here. Maybe
you could just try to be like
her.
Ripley closes the doll's eyes and hands her back.
Newt rolls her eyes as if to say ""don't pull that
five-year-old shit on me, lady. I'm six.""
NEWT
Ripley...she doesn't have
bad dreams because she's just
a piece of plastic.
RIPLEY
Oh. Sorry, Newt.
NEWT
My mommy always said there
were no monsters. No real
ones. But there are.
Ripley's expression becomes sober. She brushes damp
hair back from the child's pale forehead.
RIPLEY
(quietly)
Yes, there are, aren't there.
NEWT
Why do they tell little kids
that?
Newt's voice reveals her deep sense of betrayal.
She's seen that the world can be just as terrifying
as her most primal child's nightmare if not more
so, and that's a lot worse than finding out there is
no Santa.
RIPLEY
Well, some kids can't handle
it like you can.
NEWT
Did one of those things grow
inside her?
Ripley begins pulling blankets up an tucking them in
around her tiny body.
RIPLEY
I don't know, Newt. That's
the truth.
NEWT
Isn't that how babies come?
I mean people babies...they
grow inside you?
RIPLEY
No, it's different, honey.
NEWT
Did you ever have a baby?
RIPLEY
Yes. A little girl.
NEWT
Where is she?
RIPLEY
(quietly)
Gone.
NEWT
You mean dead.
It's more statement than question. Ripley nods slowly.
She turns, reaching for a PORTABLE SPACE HEATER
sitting nearby, and slides it closer to the bed. She
switches it on. It HUMS and emits a cozy orange
glow.
NEWT
Ripley, I was just thinking...
Maybe I could do you a favor and
fill in for her. Just for a
while. You can try it and if
you don't like it, it's okay.
I'll understand. No big deal.
Whattya think?
Ripley gazes at her a long time before answering...
a conflict between the urge to crush the child to her
in a forever hug and the knowledge that neither of them
may see another dawn.
RIPLEY
I think it's not the worst idea
I've heard all day. Let's talk
about it later.
She switches off the light and starts to rise. Newt
grabs her arm. A plaintive voice in the dark.
NEWT
Don't go! Please.
RIPLEY
I'll be right in the other
room, Newt. And look...I can
see you on that camera right
up there.
Newt looks at the VIDEO SECURITY CAMERA above the door.
Ripley unsnaps the TRACKER BRACELET given to her by
Hicks and puts it on Newt's tiny wrist, cinching it
down.
RIPLEY
Here. Take is for luck. Now
go to sleep...and don't dream.
Ripley walks away and Newt rolls on her side, hugging
Casey and gazing at the hypnotically pulsing function
light on the bracelet. The space heater hums
comfortingly.
INT. MED LAB 123
ECU Gorman, his eyelids slitted open like those of a
corpse, but with the eyes tracking erratically. The
only sign of life.
RIPLEY
(voice over)
How is he?
Ripley stands over the Lieutenant, who is lying
motionless on an examining table. Bishop looks up
from his instruments nearby, the light of a single
gooseneck lamp giving his features a macabre cast.
BISHOP
I've isolated a neuro-muscular
toxin responsible for the
paralysis. It seems to be
metabolizing. He should wake
up soon.
RIPLEY
Now let me get this straight.
The aliens paralyzed the colonists,
carried them over there,
cocooned them to be hosts for
more of those...
Ripley points at the stasis cylinders containing the
face-hugger specimens.
RIPLEY
Which would mean lots of
those parasites, right? One
for each person...over a hundred
at least.
BISHOP
Yes. That follows.
RIPLEY
But these things come from
eggs...so where are all the
eggs coming from.
BISHOP
That is the question of the
hour. We could assume a parallel
to certain insect forms who
have hivelike organization.
An ant of termite colony, for
example, is ruled by a single
female, a queen, which is the
source of new eggs.
RIPLEY
You're saying one of those things
lays all the eggs?
BISHOP
Well, the queen is always physically
larger then the others. A
termite queen's abdomen is so
bloated with eggs that it can't
move at all. It is fed and tended
by drone workers, defended by
the warriors. She is the center
of their lives, quite literally
the mother of their society.
RIPLEY
Could it be intelligent?
BISHOP
Hard to say. It may have been
blind instinct...attraction to
the heat of whatever...but she
did choose to incubate her eggs
in the one spot where we couldn't
destroy her without destroying
ourselves. That's if she exists,
of course.
Ripley ponders the ramifications of Bishop's analysis.
RIPLEY
(rising)
I want those specimens destroyed
as soon as you're done with them.
You understand?
Bishop glances at the creatures, pulsing malevolently
in their cylinders.
BISHOP
Mr. Burke have instructions
that they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return to the
company labs. He was very specific.
Ripley feels the fabric of her self-restraint tearing.
She slaps the intercom switch.
RIPLEY
Burke!
INT. MED LAB ANNEX 124
In a small observation chamber separated from the med
lab by a glass partition, Ripley and Burke have
squared off.
BURKE
Those specimens are worth
millions to the bio-weapons
division. Now, if you're smart
we can both come out of this
heroes. Set up for life.
RIPLEY
You just try getting a dangerous
organism past ICC quarantine.
Section 22350 of the Commerce Code.
BURKE
You've been doing your homework.
Look, they can't impound it if
they don't know about it.
RIPLEY
But they will know about it, Burke.
From me. Just like they'll know
how you were responsible for the
deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven
colonists here --
BURKE
Now, wait a second --
RIPLEY
(stepping on him)
You sent them to that ship. I
just checked the colony log...
directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine.
Signed Burke, Carter J.
Ripley's fury is peaking, now that the frustration and
rage finally have a target to focus on.
RIPLEY
You sent them out there and you
didn't even warn them, Burke.
Why didn't you warn them?
BURKE
Look, maybe the thing didn't even
exist, right? And if I'd made it
a major security situation, the
Administration would've stepped
in. Then no exclusive rights,
nothing.
He shrugs, his manner blase, dismissive.
BURKE
It was a bad call, that's all.
Ripley snaps. She slams him against the wall, surprising
herself and him, her hands gripping his collar.
RIPLEY
Bad call? These people are fucking
dead, Burke! Well, they're going
to nail your hide to the shed...
and I'll be there when they do.
She steps back, shaking, and looks at him with utter
loathing, as if the depths of human greed are a far
more horrific revelation than any alien.
BURKE
(sadly)
I expected more of you, Ripley.
I thought you would be smarter
than this.
RIPLEY
Sorry to disappoint you.
She turns away and strides out. The door closes.
Burke stares after her, his mind a whirl of options.
INT. CORRIDOR 125
Ripley is walking toward operations when a STRIDENT
ALARM begins to sound. She breaks into a run.
INT. OPERATIONS 126
Ripley double-times it to Hicks' TACTICAL CONSOLE
where Hudson and Vasquez have already gathered. Hicks
slaps a switch, killing the alarm.
HICKS
They're coming. They're in
the tunnel.
The TRILLING of the motion sensor remains, speeding up.
TWO RED LIGHTS on the tactical display light up
simultaneously with an echoing crash of gunfire which
vibrates the floor.
HICKS
Guns A and B. Tracking and firing
on multiple targets.
The RSS guns pound away, echoing through the complex.
Their separate bursts overlap in an irregular rhythm.
A counter on the display counts down the number of
rounds fired.
HUDSON
They must be wall to wall in
there. Look at those ammo counters
go. It's a shooting gallery down
there.
INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - TIGHT ON RSS GUNS 127
blasting stroboscopically in the tunnels. Their barrels
are overheating, glowing cherry red. One CLICKS empty
and sits smoking, still swiveling to track targets it
can't fire upon.
INT. OPERATIONS 128
The digital counter on B gun reads zero.
HICKS
B gun's dry. Twenty on A.
Ten. Five. That's it.
SILENCE. Then a GONGLIKE BOOMING echoes eerily up from
sublevel.
RIPLEY
They're at the fire door.
The BOOMING INCREASES in volume and ferocity.
HUDSON
Man, listen to that.
Mixed with the echoing crash-clang is a nerve-wrecking
SCREECH of claws on steel. The intercom buzzes,
startling them.
BISHOP
(voice over)
Bishop here. I'm afraid I have
some bad news.
HUDSON
Well, that's a switch.
INT. OPERATIONS - MINUTES LATER 129
Everyone, including Bishop, is crowded at the window,
intently watching the AP station which is a dim
silhouette in the mist. Suddenly a column of flame,
like an acetylene torch, jets upward from the complex
at the base of the cone.
BISHOP
That's it. See it? Emergency
venting.
RIPLEY
How long until it blows?
BISHOP
I'm projecting total systems
failure in a little under four
hours. The blast radius will be
about thirty kilometers. About
equal to ten megatons.
HICKS
We got problems.
HUDSON
I don't fucking believe this.
Do you believe this?
RIPLEY
And it's too late to shut it down?
BISHOP
I'm afraid so. The crash did too
much damage. The overload is
inevitable, at this point.
HUDSON
Oh, man. And I was gettin' short,
too! Four more weeks and out.
Now I'm gonna buy it on this fuckin'
rock. It ain't half fair, man!
VASQUEZ
Hudson, give us a break.
They watch as another gas jet lights up the fog-shrouded
landscape.
RIPLEY
(to Hicks)
We need the other drop-ship. The
on one the Sulaco. We have to
bring it down on remote, somehow.
HUDSON
How? The transmitter was on the
APC. It's wasted.
RIPLEY
(pacing)
I don't care how! Think of a
way. Think of something.
HUDSON
Think of what? We're fucked.
RIPLEY
What about the colony transmitter?
That up-link tower down at the
other end. Why can't we use that?
BISHOP
I checked. The hard wiring
between here and there was severed
in the fighting.
Ripley is wound up like a dynamo, her mind spinning out
options, grim solutions.
RIPLEY
Well then somebody's just going
to have to go out there. Take a
portable terminal and go out there
and plug in manually.
HUDSON
Oh, right! Right! With those
things running around. No way.
BISHOP
(quietly)
I'll go.
RIPLEY
What?
BISHOP
I'm really the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship anyway.
Believe me, I'd prefer not to. I
may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
RIPLEY
All right. Let's get on it. What'll
you need?
VASQUEZ
Listen. It's stopped.
They listen. Nothing. An instant later comes the
HIGH-PITCHED TRILLING of a motion-sensor alarm. Hicks
looks at the tactical board.
HICKS
Well, they're into the complex.
INT. MED LAB 130
One of the acid holes from the colonists' siege has
yielded access to subfloor conduits. Bishop lying in
the opening, reaches up to graph the portable terminal
as Ripley hands it down to him. He pushes it into
the constricted shaft ahead of him. She then hands him
a small satchel containing tools and assorted patch
cables, a service pistol and a small cutting torch.
BISHOP
This duct runs almost to the
up-link assembly. One hundred
eighty meters. Say, forty minutes
to crawl down there. One hour
to patch in and align the antenna.
Thirty minutes to prep the ship,
then about fifty minutes flight time.
Ripley looks at her watch.
RIPLEY
It's going to be closer. You
better get going.
BISHOP
(cheerfully)
See you soon.
She squirms into the shaft, pushing the equipment along
ahead of him with a scraping rhythm. The diameter of
the conduit is barely larger than the width of his
shoulders. Vasquez slides a metal plate over the hole
and begins spot welding it in place.
INT. CONDUIT 131
Bishop looks back as the welder seals him in. He sighs
fatalistically and squirms forward. Ahead of him the
conduit dwindles straight to seeming infinity. Like
being in the bore of a very long Howitzer.
INT. MED LAB 132
Ripley jumps as an ALARM suddenly blares through the
complex.
HICKS
(voice over)
They're in the approach corridor.
RIPLEY
(into mike)
On my way.
Ripley jumps up, unslinging a FLAMETHROWER from her
shoulder in one motion, and sprints for Operations with
Vasquez. The sound of SENTRY GUNS opening up in
staccato bursts echoes from close by.
INT. OPERATIONS 133
Ripley runs to the tactical console where Hicks is
mesmerized by the images from the surveillance cameras.
The flashes of the sentry guns flare out the sensitive
video, but impressions of figures moving in the smoky
corridor are occasionally visible. The robot sentries
hammer away, driving streamers of tracer fire into
the swirling mist.
HICKS
Twenty meters and closing.
Fifteen. C and D guns down
about fifty percent.
The digital readout whirl through descending numbers.
An inhuman SHRILL SCREECHING is audible between bursts
of fire.
RIPLEY
Now many?
HICKS
Can't tell. Lots. D gun's
down to twenty. Ten. It's out.
Then the firing from the remaining guns stop abruptly.
The video image is a swirling wall of smoke. Small fires
burn, dim glows in the mist. There are black and
twisted shapes, and pieces of twisted shapes, scattered
at the edge of visibility. However, nothing emerges
from the wall of smoke. The motion sensor TONE shuts off.
RIPLEY
They retreated. The guns stopped
them.
The moment stretches. Everyone exhales slowly.
HICKS
Yeah. But look...
The digital counters for the two sentry guns read ""0""
and ""10"" respectively. Less than a second's worth of
firing.
HICKS
Newt time then can walk right
up and knock.
RIPLEY
But they don't know that. They're
probably looking for other ways
to get in. That'll take them awhile.
HUDSON
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
HICKS
(to Vasquez
and Hudson)
I want you two walking the perimeter.
I know we're all in strung out
shape but stay frosty and alert.
We've got to stop any entries before
they get out of hand.
The two troopers nod and head for the corridor. Ripley
sighs and picks up a cup of cold coffee, draining it in
one gulp.
HICKS
How long since you slept?
Twenty-four hours?
Ripley shrugs. She seems soul weary, drained by the
nerve-wracking tension. When she answers, her voice
seems distant, detached.
RIPLEY
(grimly)
They'll get us.
HICKS
Maybe. Maybe not.
RIPLEY
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like
those others. You'll take care of
it won't you, it if comes to that?
HICKS
If it comes to that, I'll do us
both. Let's see that it doesn't
Here, I'd like to introduce you to
a close personal friend of mine.
He picks up his pulse-rifle and with the casually precise
movements of long practice he snaps open the bolt, drops
out the magazine and hands it to her.
HICKS
M-41A 10mm pulse-rifle, over and
under with a 30mm pump-action
grenade launcher.
Ripley hefts the weapon. It is heavy and awkward. But
there is an irrational promise of security in its lethal
cold steel lines, to at least the sense that she will
be in some greater measure the master of her own fate.
She raises it clumsily.
RIPLEY
What do I do?
INT. CONDUIT 134
Bishop is in claustrophobic limbo between two echoing
infinities. The pipe rings with his scraping advance.
He approaches an irregular hole which admits a tiny
shaft of light. He puts his eyes up to the acid-etched
opening.
HIS P.O.V. as drooling jaws flash toward us, SLAMMING
against the steel with a vicious scraping SNAP.
Bishop flattens himself away from the opening and
inches along, looking pale and strained. He glances at
his watch.
INT. OPERATIONS 135
Ripley has the stock of the M-41A snugged up to her cheek
and is awkwardly trying to keep up with Hicks'
instructions. The Corporal is standing close behind her,
positioning her arms. It's intimate but that's the
last thing on their minds.
HICKS
Just pull it in real right. It
will kick some. When the counter
here heads zero, hit this...
He thumbs a button and the magazine drops out, clattering
on the floor.
HICKS
Just let it drop right out. Get
the other one in quick. Just
slap it in hard, it likes abuse.
Now, pull the bolt.
CLACK.
HICKS
You're ready again.
Ripley repeats the action, not very smoothly. Her hands
are trembling. She indicates a stout TUBE underneath
the slender pulse-rifle barrel.
RIPLEY
What's this?
HICKS
Well, that's the grenade launcher
...you probably don't want to
mess with that.
RIPLEY
Look, you started this. Now show
me everything. I can handle myself.
HICKS
Yeah. I've noticed.
INT. CORRIDOR 136
DOLLYING WITH Ripley walking down the corridor, now
carrying the newfound friend, the M-41A. Gorman steps
out of the door to the med lab, looking weak but sound.
Burke is right behind him.
RIPLEY
How do you feel?
GORMAN
All right, I guess. One hell
of a hangover. Look, Ripley...
I...
RIPLEY
Forget it.
She shoulders by him into the med lab. Gorman turns to
see Vasquez staring at him with cold, slitted eyes.
GORMAN
You still want to kill me?
VASQUEZ
(turning away)
It won't be necessary.
INT. MED LAB - ANNEX 137
Ripley crosses the deserted lab, passing through the
annex to the small O.R. where she left Newt.
INT. MED LAB - O.R. 138
Entering the darkened chamber, Ripley looks around.
Newt is nowhere to be seen. On a hunch she kneels down
and peers under the bed. Newt is curled up there,
jammed as far back as she can get, fast asleep. Still
clutching ""Casey.""
Ripley stares at Newt's tiny face, so angelic despite
the demons that have chased her through her dreams and
the reality between dreams. Ripley lays the rifle on
top of the cot and crawls carefully underneath. Without
waking the little girl, she slips her arms around her.
Ripley becomes merely the larger of two children huddling
together in the darkness under their bed.
Newt's face contorts with the externalization of some
tormented dreamscape. She cries out, a vague inarticulate
plea. Ripley rocks her gently.
RIPLEY
There, there. Sssshh. It's all
right.
EXT. Up-LINK TOWER - VIEW OF AP STATION 139
A VIEW OF the processing station from the colony landing
platform. A rising wind is clearing out the low fog and
the silhouette of the station grows sharper. Several
systems of high pressure conduits at the base of the
conical tower are actually glowing dull red with heat in
the darkness. High voltage discharges arc around the
upper latticework, lighting the blighted landscape
with irregular glaring flashes.
PAN ONTO BISHOP, F.G. hunched against the wind at the
base of the telemetry tower. He has a TEST-BAY PANEL
open and the portable terminal patched in. His jacket
is draped over the keyboard and monitor unit to protect
it from the elements and he is typing frenetically.
BISHOP
(to himself)
Now, if I did it right...
He punches a key marked ""ENABLE.""
INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT 140
The drop bay is empty and silent, with the remaining
ship brooding in the shadows. A KLAXON sounds and
rotating clearance lights come on. Hydraulics whine
to life. Drop-ship two moves out on its overhead track
and is lowered into the drop bay fro launch-prep.
Service booms and fueling couplers move in automatically
around the hull. A recorded announcement echoes across
the huge chamber.
FEMALE VOICE
Attention. Attention. Automatic
fueling operations have begun.
Please extinguish all smoking
materials.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - TIGHT ON RIPLEY - MED LAB 141
as she awakens with a start. She checks her watch...
an hour has passed. She gently disengages herself from
Newt and is about to crawl out from beneath the cot
when she sees something and FREEZES.
Across the room, just inside the door to the med lab,
are two innocuous but nonetheless chilling objects.
TWO STASIS CYLINDERS. Their tops are hinged open, and
the suspension fields are switched off. They are both
EMPTY. Ripley feels a slow upwelling wave of terror
rise through her in that silent frozen moment...the
inescapable certainty of a lethal presence. Unable to
move or breathe, she looks around frantically, assessing
the situation.
RIPLEY
(whispers)
Newt. Newt, wake up.
NEWT
Wah...? Where are...?
RIPLEY
(whispers)
Sssh. Don't move. We're in
trouble.
Newt nods, now wide awake. They listen in the darkness
for the slightest betrayal of movement. The scrabble
of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example.
There is only the droning HUM of the little space heater.
Ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the
underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the
wall.
The SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor
is jarringly loud in the stillness.
When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides
herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot,
reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the
mattress. Here yes clear the edge of the bed. The rifle
is GONE.
She snaps her head around. A SCUTTLING SHAPE LEAPS
TOWARD HER from the foot of the bed! She ducks with
a startled cry. The obscene thing hits the wall above
her, legs moving lightning fast. Reflexively she slams
the bed against the wall, pinning the creature inches
above her face. Its legs and tail writhe with
incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing
SQUEAL.
Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a
frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot. She
flips it over, trapping the creature underneath.
They back away, gasping. Ripley's eyes flash around
the shadowed room where every corner of space
between equipment holds lethal promise. The creature
scuttles from beneath the bed and disappears under a
back of cabinets in a blur. Ripley hugs Newt close
and heads toward the door, moving as if every object in
the room had a million volts running through it. She
reaches the door. Hits the wall switch. Nothing
happens. Disabled from outside. She tries the lights.
Nothing. She pounds on the door. The acoustically
dampened door panel thunks dully. She moves to the
observation window, glancing frantically over her
shoulder. The bare floor behind her is like a screaming
threat.
RIPLEY
(shouting)
Hey...hey!
She pounds on the window. Through the double
thickness window we can SEE that the lab is dark and
empty. Ripley whirls, hearing a loathsome scrabbling
behind her. Newt starts to whimper, feeding off her
fear. She steps in front of the video surveillance
camera and waves her arms in a circle.
RIPLEY
Hicks! Hicks!
INT. OPERATIONS - TIGHT ON VIDEO MONITOR 142
showing Ripley waving her arms. There is no sound,
a surreal pantomime.
A hand ENTERS FRAME and switches off the monitor.
Ripley's image vanishes.
WIDER ANGLE as Burke straightens casually from
the console. Hicks is talking via headset with
Bishop and hasn't noticed Ripley's plight or
Burke's action.
HICKS
(into mike)
Roger. Check back when you've
activated the ship.
(turning)
He's at the up-link tower.
BURKE
(calmly)
Excellent.
INT. OPERATING ROOM 143
Ripley picks up a steel chair and slams it against
the observation window. It bounces back from the
high-impact material. She tries again.
REVERSE ANGLE from the med lab side, showing her
futile efforts, the chair hitting with a dull THWACK
barely audible through the double thickness pressure
port.
Ripley turns, studying the room. She fumbles through
a clutter of equipment on a counter next to her and
finds a SMALL EXAMINATION LIGHT. Snapping it on she
plays the beam over the walls. Tall assemblies of
surgical and anaethesiology equipment loom in the
dark. She hears, ot thinks she hears, movements. The
light spins across the room, swiveling and bobbing
frantically. Like an indicator of her growing panic.
Newt starts a thin, high wailing.
NEWT
Mommy...mommmyyyyy...
Ripley steadies herself, realizing Newt's terror and
the child's dependence on her. She plays the beam
across the ceiling. Holds on something. Gets an idea.
She removes her lighter from a jacket pocket and picks
up some papers from the counter. Moving cautiously
she boosts Newt up onto the SURGICAL TABLE in the center
of the room and clambers up after her.
NEWT
Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm
scared.
RIPLEY
I know, honey. Me too.
Ripley lights the papers and holds the flaming mass
under the temperature sensor of a fire control system
SPRINKLER HEAD. It triggers, spraying the room from
several sources with water. An ALARM sounds throughout
the complex.
INT. OPERATIONS 144
Hicks jumps at the sound of the alarm, finally
identifying its source among the lights flashing on
his board. He bolts for the door, yelling into his
headset as he moves.
HICKS
Vasquez, Hudson, meet me in
medical! We got a fire!
INT. OPERATING ROOM 145
Ripley and Newt are drenched as the sprinklers
continue to drizzle in the darkness. The SIREN
hoots maniacally, masking all other sound. Ripley
scans the room with her light, her hair plastered
to her face, wiping water out of her eyes. She is
eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT. She
looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away.
Looks away. Her eyes snap back. SOMETHING LEAPS AT
HER FACE. She SCREAMS and topples off the table,
splashing to the floor. Newt shrieks and scrambles
away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of
her. It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings
for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a
steel spring. Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling
equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the
floor in a frenzy of motion. In a blurr of
multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body.
She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for
its size. It moves like lightning toward her head,
avoiding her fumbling hands. Newt screams abjectly,
backing away, until she is pressed up against a
desk in one corner.
Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body
back from her face. The thing's tail whips around
her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside
of its body close to her. Ripley thrashes about,
knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING.
Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her
and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's
body.
ANGLE ON NEWT as crablike legs appear from behind the
desk, right behind her. She sees it and, thinking
fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the
writhing thing. The desk jumps and shudders against
all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it.
She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature
gets one leg free, then another and another. Squeezing
itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her.
The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's
head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head
from side to side. The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly
from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing
itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over
her face.
A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette
behind the misted-over glass. A hand wipes a clear spot.
Hick's eyes appear. He steps back. WHAM! A burst of
pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass. Hicks
dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes
into the room in a shower of fragments. He hits
rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and
slides across to Ripley. He gets his fingers around the
thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls. Between
the two of them they force is away from her face,
though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens
sickeningly around her throat. Hudson leaps into the
room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding
across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature
against the wall. Point-blank. Acid and smoke.
Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail,
unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor
coil from her throat. All of them grip the struggling,
SHRIEKING creature.
HICKS
The corner! Ready?
HUDSON
Do it!
Hicks hurls the thing into the corner. It scrabbles
upright in an instant and leaps back toward them.
WHAM! Hudson gets it clean.
Ripley collapses, gagging. The alarm and sprinklers
shut off automatically. Hicks sees the stasis
cylinders.
RIPLEY
(coughing)
Burke...it was Burke.
INT. OPERATIONS - ANGLE ON HUDSON 146
looking decidedly stressed-out. He grips his rifle
tightly, AIMED RIGHT AT CAMERA.
HUDSON
(intense)
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now!
THE GROUP is gathered around Burke who sits in a
chair, maintaining an icy calm although beads of
sweat betray intense concealed tension. Only a few
minutes have passes and everyone is still buzzed on
adrenaline, as if the whole group is charged with
high voltage.
HICKS
(pacing)
I don't get it. It doesn't
make any Goddamn sense.
Ripley stands in front of Burke, every fiber of
her being accusing him with absolute outrage. Burke
tries to break Ripley's stare, which is like a
diamond drill. He can't.
RIPLEY
He wanted an alien, only he
couldn't get it back through
quarantine. But if we were impregnated
...whatever you call it...and then
frozen for the trip back at just
the right time...then nobody would
know about the embryos we were carrying.
We and Newt.
Ripley glances at the little girl, a frail figure
sitting nearby, hugging her knees and watching the
proceedings with somber eyes. She is all but lost in
an adult jacket someone has found for her, and her still
damp hair is plastered to her forehead and cheeks.
HICKS
Wait a minute. We'd know about it.
RIPLEY
The only way it would work is if
he sabotaged certain freezers
on the trip back. Then he could
jettison the bodies and make up
any story he liked.
HUDSON
Fuuuck! He's dead.
(to Burke)
You're dogmeat, pal.
BURKE
This is total paranoid delusion.
It's pitiful.
RIPLEY
(wearily)
You know, Burke, I don't know
which species is worse. You don't
see them screwing each other over
for a fucking percentage.
HICKS
(serious)
Let's waste him.
(to Burke)
No offense.
Ripley shakes her head, the rage giving way to a
sickened emptiness.
RIPLEY
Just find someplace to lock him
up until it's time to --
THE LIGHTS GO OUT. Everyone stops in the sudden darkness,
realizing instinctively it is a new escalation in the
struggle. Hicks looks at the board. Everything is out.
Doors. Video screens.
RIPLEY
They cut the power.
HUDSON
What do you mean, they cut the
power? How could they cut the
power, man? They're animals.
Ripley picks up her rifle and thumbs off the safety.
RIPLEY
Newt! Stay close.
(to the others)
Let's get some trackers going.
Come on, get moving. Gorman, watch
Burke.
Hudson and Vasquez pick up their scanners and move to
the door. Vasquez has to slide it open manually on its
track.
INT. CORRIDOR 147
The two troopers separate and move rapidly to the
barriers at opposite ends of the control block.
DOLLYING WITH VASQUEZ as she moves forward with feral
steps in the darkness.
ON HUDSON scanning the med lab and the nearby barrier.
RIPLEY
(voice over)
Anything?
BEEP. Hudson's tracker lights up, a faint signal.
HUDSON
There's something.
He pans it around. Back down the corridor. It beep
again, louder.
HUDSON
It's inside the complex.
VASQUEZ
(voice over)
You're just reading me.
HUDSON
No. No! It ain't you. They're
inside. Inside the perimeter.
They're in here.
RIPLEY
Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?
ANGLE ON VASQUEZ swinging her tracker and rifle together.
She aims it behind her. BEEP.
VASQUEZ
(cool)
Hudson may be right.
INT. OPERATIONS 148
Ripley and Hicks share a look...""here we go.""
HICKS
(low)
It's game time.
RIPLEY
Get back here, both of you. Fall
back to Operations.
INT. CORRIDOR 149
Hudson backtracks nervously, peering all around. He
looks stretched to the limit.
HUDSON
This signal's weird...must be
some interference or something.
There's movement all over the
place...
RIPLEY
(voice over)
Just get back here!
Hudson reaches the door to operations at a run, a
moment before Vasquez. They pull the door shut and
lock it.
INT. OPERATIONS 150
Hudson joins Ripley and Hicks, who are laying out their
armament. Flamethrowers. Grenades. M-41A magazines.
Hudson's tracker beeps. Then again. The tone continues
through the SCENE, its rhythm increasing.
HUDSON
Movement! Signal's clean.
He pans the scanner. Stops. The range display reads
out, counting down.
HUDSON
Range twenty meters.
RIPLEY
(to Vasquez)
Seal the door.
Vasquez picks up a hand-welder and moves to comply.
HUDSON
Seventeen meters.
HICKS
Let's get these things lit.
He hands one flamethrower to RIpley and begins priming
the other himself. It lights with a muffled POP.
Ripley's lights a moment later. Sparks shower around
Vasquez as she begins welding the door. Hudson's tracker
is beeping like mad now, as fast as their hearts.
RIPLEY
They learned. They cut the power
and avoided the guns. They must
have found another way in, something
we missed.
HICKS
We didn't miss anything.
HUDSON
Fifteen meters.
RIPLEY
I don't know, an acid hole in
a duct. Something under the
floors, not on the plans.
I don't know!
She picks up Vasquez' scanner and aims it the same
direction as Hudson's.
HUDSON
Twelve meters. Man, this is a big
fucking signal. Ten meters.
RIPLEY
They're right on us. Vasquez,
how you doing?
Vasquez is heedlessly showering herself with molten metal
as she welds the door shut. Working like a demon.
HUDSON
Nine meters. Eight.
RIPLEY
Can't be. That's inside the room!
HUDSON
It's readin' right. Look!
Ripley fiddles with her tracker, adjusting the tuning.
HICKS
Well you're not reading it right!
HUDSON
Six meters. Five. What the fu --
He looks at Ripley. It dawns on both of them at the same
time. She feels a cold premonitory dread as she angles
her tracker upward to the ceiling, almost overhead. The
tone gets louder.
Hicks climbs onto a file cabinet and raises a panel of
acoustic drop-ceiling. He shines his light inside.
HICKS' P.O.V. 151
A soul-wrenching nightmare image. Moving in the beam of
light are aliens. Lots of aliens. They are crawling
like bats, upside down, clinging to the pipes and beams
of the structural ceiling, not touching the flimsy
acoustic panels. They glisten hideously as they claw
their way forward in silence. They cover the ceiling
of the operations room. The inner sanctum is utterly
violated.
ON HICKS 152
blasted by fear.
Something moves...he snaps the light around. It's a
meter behind him. IT LUNGES! He drops reflexively,
the claws raking across his armor.
Hicks falls into the room just as the creatures detach
en masse from the handholds. THE CEILING EXPLODES,
raining debris. Nightmare shapes drop into the room.
Newt screams. Hudson opens fire. Vasquez grabs Hicks,
pulls him up, firing one handed with her flamethrower.
Ripley scoops up Newt and staggers back. Gorman turns
to fire and Burke bolts for the only remaining exit,
the corridor connecting to the med lab. In the
strobelike glare of the pulse-rifles we SEE flashes
of aliens, moving forward in the smoke from the
flamethrower fires. They move like nothing human...
leaping quick as insects at times or gliding with
powerful, balletic grace.
RIPLEY
Medical! Get to medical!
She dashes for the corridor.
INT. MED LAB CORRIDOR 153
DOLLYING BEHIND HER as she sprints, the walls becoming
a frenzied blur. Ahead of her Burke clears the door to
the med lab. HE SLIDES IT CLOSED. Ripley slams into
the door. Tries the latch. Hears it LOCK from the far
side.
RIPLEY
Burke! Open the door!
NEWT
Look!
Behind her an alien is moving down the corridor like a
locomotive, a graceful skeleton shape as lethal and
inhuman as you can imagine. Strobe flashes backlight
the demented silhouette. Shaking, Ripley raises her
rifle. She squeezes the trigger. NOTHING HAPPENS.
The creature HISSES, baring its teeth as it advances.
Ripley checks the SAFETY. The safety is off. The
DIGITAL COUNTER. The magazine is full. Newt begins to
wail. Ripley's hands, slick with sweat, are trembling
so much she almost drops the rifle. Panic screams in
her brain. The thing is almost on her, filling the
corridor, when she remembers. She snaps the bolt back,
chambering a round. Whips the stock to her shoulder.
FIRES. FLASH-CRACK! A FLASHBULB GLIMPSE OF shrieking
jaws as the silhouette is hurled back, screeching
insanely.
Ripley is slammed against the door by the recoil,
blinded by the flash and deafened by the concussion.
INT. OPERATIONS 154
Hicks looks up. Fires POINT-BLANK at a leaping
silhouette. SCREEEECH! The fire-control system has
tripped, with sprinklers spraying the room and a
mindless SIREN wailing. Total pandemonium.
HUDSON
(hysterical)
Let's go! Let's go!
HICKS
Fuckin' A!
Hudson screams as floor panels lift under him, and clawed
arms seize him lightning fast, dragging him down.
Another skeletal shape leaps on him from above. He
disappears into the subfloor crawlway. Hicks, Vasquez
and Gorman make it to the med lab access corridor.
INT. CORRIDOR
Stunned, Ripley sees through dissipating smoke the
creature rising to advance again. Flinching against
blast and glare she drills it POINT-BLANK with a
BLINDING BURST that carries the M-41A's muzzle right
up toward the ceiling. Newt covers her ears against
the CONCUSSION.
HICKS
(o.s.)
Hold you fire!
The troopers seem to materialize out of the smoke.
RIPLEY
(indicating door)
Locked.
HICKS
Stand back.
Hicks snaps the torch off his belt and cuts into the
lock. Inhuman shapes enter the far end of the corridor.
Vasquez hands her flamethrower to Gorman and unslings
her rifle. She starts loading 30mm grenades into the
launcher, like oversize 12-guage shells.
GORMAN
You can't use those in here!
VASQUEZ
Right. Fire in the hole!
She pumps a round up and fires. The grenade EXPLODES and
the blast almost knocks them down. Hicks kicks the door
open, molten droplets flying.
HICKS
(shouting at Vasquez)
Thanks a lot! Now I can't hear shit.
VASQUEZ
(shouting)
What?
INT. MED LAB ANNEX 156
Vasquez slides the door almost closed, then fires three
grenades rapid-fire through the gap. She slams the door
home as the grenades detonate, the explosion sounding
gonglike through the metal.
Ripley sprints across the room, trying the far door.
Burke has locked it as well. Hicks switches his
hand-torch from CUT to WELD and starts sealing the door
they just passed through.
INT. MED LAB 157
Burke, hyperventilating with terror, backs across the
dark chamber. Gasping, almost paralyzed with fear, he
crosses the chamber to the door leading to the main
concourse. His fingers reach for the latch. It moves
by itself. The door opens slowly.
ON BURKE his eyes wide, transfixed by his fate. We
hear the BULLWHIP CRACK of a tail-stinger striking as we:
CUT TO:
INT. MED LAB ANNEX 158
The door dimples with a clanging impact, separating
slightly from its frame. Another crash, the squeal of
tortured steel. Newt grabs Ripley by the hand and
tugs her across the room.
NEWT
Come on! This way.
She leads Ripley to an air vent set low in the wall and
expertly unlatches the grille, swinging it open. Newt
starts inside but Ripley pulls her back.
RIPLEY
Stay behind me.
Ripley trades her rifle for Gorman's flamethrower before
he can protest and enters the air shaft, which is a
tight fit. Newt scrambles in behind, followed by Hicks,
Gorman and Vasquez on rearguard. Glancing back
fearfully Newt pushes on Ripley's butt as they crawl
rapidly through the shaft.
NEWT
Come on. Crawl faster.
RIPLEY
DO you know how to get to the
landing field from here?
NEWT
Sure. Go left.
Ripley turns into a larger MAIN DUCT where there is
enough room to crab-walk in a low crouch. She runs,
scraping her back on the ceiling. The troopers' armor
clatters in the confined space. They approach an
intersection. She fires the flamethrower around the
corner, the looks. Clear.
NEWT
Go right.
They sprint into the narrow connecting duct, the maze
becoming a blur. Ripley fires the flamethrower
periodically, as they pass side ducts covered by
louvered grilles or vertical shafts going to higher or
lower levels.
HICKS
(into headset)
Bishop, you read me? Come in, over.
There is a long pause then Bishop's VOICE, almost
unintelligible with interference, comes over the radio.
BISHOP
(voice over;
static)
Yes, I read you. Not very well...
EXT. UP-LINK RELAY - LANDING FIELD 159
Bishop is huddled against the base of the telemetry
mast, out of the wind which is now gusting viciously.
BISHOP
(yelling;
over enunciating)
The ship is on its way. ETA
about sixteen minutes. I've
got my hands full flying...
the weather's come up a bit.
Bishop's fingers are blurring over the terminal keys and
he squints, watching the screen as the flight telemetry
updates rapidly.
In the b.g. the AP station has become a raging demon,
wreathed in boiling steam and electrical discharges.
INT. AIR DUCT 160
HICKS
All right, stand by there. We're
on out way. Over.
The beam of Ripley's light wavers hypnotically in the
tunnel ahead. She blinks, seeing something...not sure.
A GLINTING OBSCENE FORM MOVING TOWARD THEM, filling the
tunnel at the absolute limit of the light's power.
RIPLEY
Back. Go back!
They try to crawl back, jamming together. Behind them,
the way they have come, a GRATING is battered in with a
FEROCIOUS CLANG and the deadly silhouette of a warrior
flows into the duct. They are trapped. Vasquez uses
her flamethrower, bathing the tunnel in fire. Hicks
snaps out his hand-welder and cuts into the wall of the
duct. Molten metal spatters him, as sparks fill the
tunnel with lurid light. Vasquez' flamethrower sputters.
VASQUEZ
(icy)
Losing fuel.
Between eye-searing bursts of flame Ripley sees the
glistening apparitions closing in. Hicks' torch feathers
out. Empty. Bracing his back he kicks hard at the
cherry-hot metal. It bends aside.
Beyond is a narrow SERVICE WAY, lined with pipes and
conduit. Hicks slides through the searing hole,
lifting Newt safely through as Ripley hands her out.
Ripley follows and turns to help Gorman. Vasquez'
flamethrower goes dry. She draws her SERVICE PISTOL.
Suddenly she looks up as a WARRIOR SCREECHES DOWN FROM
A VERTICAL SHAFT, right above her.
She fires with incredible rapidity...BAM! BAM! BAM!
Rolls aside. It lands on her legs and she snaps her head
to one side just as its TAIL STINGER buries into the
metal wall beside her cheek. She fires again, emptying
the pistol, kicking the thrashing shape away.
Acid cuts through her chickenplate armor, searing into
her thigh. She cries out, gritting her teeth against
the white-hot pain. Gorman sees Vasquez hit, unable to
move. Sees the creatures coming the other way...and
turns away from the escape hole. He crawls back to her,
grabs her battle harness and starts dragging her towards
safety. Too late. The approaching alien warriors have
reached and passed the opening. Vasquez sees him,
barely conscious.
VASQUEZ
(hoarse whisper)
You always were an asshole, Gorman.
She seizes his hand in a deadly drip, but we RECOGNIZE
it as the ""power greeting"" she shared with Drake...
something for the chosen few. Gorman returns the grip.
He hands her two grenades and arms two himself as the
creatures are upon them.
INT. SERVICE WAY 161
RUSHING WITH Ripley, Newt and Hicks as a full tilt run.
The service way lights up with a POWERFUL BLAST behind
them and they stumble with the shock wave. Newt breaks
out ahead and it's all Ripley and Hicks can do to keep
up.
NEWT
This way. Come on, we're almost
there!
RIPLEY
Newt, wait!
The kid moves like lightning, diving and dodging around
obstacles. If it wasn't clear before it's clear now
that we are on her turf, and she's the ace. Running on
and on, their breathing loud and echoing...the walls
a directionless blur. Newt never hesitates.
They reach a junction with a narrow ANGLED CHUTE which
runs upward at a steep 45 degrees.
NEWT
Here! Go up.
INT. CHUTE 162
Ripley looks up the angles shaft, seeing light at the
top...an exterior vent hood. The sound of wind booms
down from above. Like blowing across a bottle top
vastly amplified.
Ripley enters, bracing her feet on perilously narrow
side ribs in the shaft. She looks down. The chute
descends far into the depths, lost in shadow. She
starts to climb with Next behind/below her, and Hicks,
just emerging from the side duct.
NEWT
Just up there --
Newt slips, a rusted rib collapsing under her foot. She
slides...catches herself with one hand. Ripley reaches
for her, dropping her light. The hand-light goes
skittering and bumping down the chute, around a bend,
and disappears.
Ripley strains, reaching, her hand groping for Newt's.
They miss, inches apart.
NEWT
Riiiiipppleee --
She slips. Hicks lunges, grabbing her oversized jacket.
AND SHE SLIPS OUT OF IT. With an echoing scream Newt
plummets, sliding down the chute into darkness.
MOVING WITH HER, the walls racing by in a dizzy blur like
a bobsled ride. THe shaft pitches left. Newt bounces,
sliding halfway up the wall. The chute forks ahead.
Newt tumbles into the right shaft, which drops at a
steeper angle into the depths. Just disappearing down
the LEFT SHAFT we SEE Ripley's light.
Ripley looks Hicks in the eye. And kicks free...sliding
down the chute after Newt. Ripley slams her feet into
the side-ribs, bracing herself in a controlled descent.
Ripley reaches the ""V."" Sees the glow of the light in
the left fork. She goes left.
RIPLEY
Newt!
She hears a plaintive reply, so echoey and distorted it
has no direction.
NEWT
(o.s.)
Mommy...where are you?
Ripley reaches the bottom of the chute where it
intersects with a HORIZONTAL SERVICE TUNNEL. The light
is lying there, but no Newt. The echoing wail comes
again.
NEWT
(o.s.)
Moooommeeee...
Ripley starts down the tunnel, answering. Newt's call
comes again. Fainter? She can't tell. She spins in
a growing panic, starts the other way.
RIPLEY
(to her headset)
Hicks, get down here. I need
that locator.
INT. SUBBASEMENT 163
Newt is in a low grottolike chamber, filled with pipes
and machines. It is flooded, almost up to Newt's waist.
She looks up, seeing light streaming through a grating.
Ripley's voice seems to come from there.
RIPLEY
(o.s.)
Newt! Star wherever you are!
Newt climbs some pipes, straining to reach the grating.
INT. SERVICE TUNNEL 164
Hicks joins Ripley, unsnapping the emergency-locator
from his belt. They follow the signal into a lighted
area where the power apparently was not cut.
HICKS
This way. We're close...
Following the signal they come to a grating set in the
floor.
NEWT
Here! I'm here. I'm here.
Ripley runs to the grating. Looking down she sees Newt's
tearstreaked face. Newt reaches up. Her tiny fingers
wriggle up through the bars of the grate. Ripley
squeezes the child's precious fingertips.
RIPLEY
Climb down, honey. We have to
cut through this grate.
Newt backs away, climbing down the pipe as Hicks cuts
into the bars with his hand-torch.
INT. SUBBASEMENT 165
Newt, standing waist deep in the water, watches sparks
shower blindingly as Hicks cuts. She bites her lip,
trembling. Cold and terrified. Silently a glistening
shape rises in one graceful motion from the water behind
her. It stands, dripping, dwarfing her tiny form. Newt
turns, sensing the movement...She SCREAMS as the
shadow engulfs her.
INT. SERVICE TUNNEL 166
Ripley panics, hearing screaming below, then splashing.
She and Hicks kick desperately at the grating, smashing
it down. Heedless of the cherry-hot edges Ripley
lunges into the hole with her light.
RIPLEY
Newt! Newt!
The surface of the water reflects the beam placidly.
Newt is gone. Bobbing in the water, eyes staring, is
""Casey"" the doll head. In sinks slowly, distorting,
vanishing in darkness.
Hicks pulls Ripley away from the hole. She struggles
furiously, trying to tear out of his grip.
RIPLEY
No! Noooo!
He drags her back. It takes all of his strength.
HICKS
(intense)
She's gone! Let's go!
He sees something moving toward them through a lattice
of pipes. Ripley is irrational. Hysterical.
RIPLEY
No! No! She's alive! We
have to --
HICKS
All right! She's alive. I
believe it. But we gotta get
moving! Now!
He drags her toward an ELEVATOR not far away at the
end of the tunnel. Gets her inside, slamming her against
the back wall. Hits the button to go to surface level.
An alien warrior leaps into the tunnel, starts
toward them. The doors are closing. Not fast enough.
The creature gets one arm through, the doors closing on
it. THEY OPEN AGAIN, an automatic safety feature. THE
WARRIOR HISSES, LUNGING. Hicks FIRES, POINT-BLANK. It
spins away, SCREECHING. Acid sluices between the closing
doors, across Hicks' armored chest plate, as he shields
Ripley with his body. The lift starts upward. Hicks'
fingers race with the clasps as the stuff eats its way
toward his skin. Galvanized out of her hysteria, Ripley
claws at his armor, helping him as much as she can. He
screams as the acid contacts his chest and arm. He
shucks out of the combat armor like a madman, dropping
the smoking pieces to the floor. Acrid fumes fill the
air, searing eyes and lungs. The elevator stops. The
doors part and they stumble out, Ripley supporting Hicks
who is doubled over in agony.
RIPLEY
Come on, you can make it.
Almost there.
EXT. LANDING FIELD 167
Drop-ship two descends toward the landing grid,
side-slipping in hurricane gusts. Bishop stands, guiding
it with the portable terminal. The ship sets down hard.
Slides sideways. Stops. Bishop turns as Ripley and
Hicks stumble out of a doorway in the colony building
behind him. He goes to them, helping to support Hicks
and they run toward the ship, buffeted by the gale.
Ripley shouts, her words barely audible over the wind.
RIPLEY
HOW MUCH TIME?
BISHOP
PLENTY! TWENTY-SIX MINUTES!
RIPLEY
WE'RE NOT LEAVING!
The loading ramp deploys and they run into the ship.
EXT. PROCESSING STATION 168
An infernal engine, roaring out of control. Steam blasts
and swirls, lightning zaps around the superstructure and
columns of incandescent gas thunder hundreds of feet into
the air.
We APPROACH, hypnotically. The drop-ship ENTERS FRAME,
moving toward the station. It pivots, hovering in the
blasting turbulence, and settles onto a NARROW LANDING
PLATFORM ten levels above the ground, or about a third
of the way up the enormous structure.
INT. DROP-SHIP 169
Ripley finishes winding tape around a bulky object and
drops the roll. She has crudely fastened a M-41A
assault rifle together, side by side, with a flamethrower.
A massive, unwieldy package of absolute firepower. Her
movements are curt, precise...determined. She works
rapidly, snatching magazines, grenades, belts and other
gear from the fully stocked ordnance racks of the
drop-ship.
Bishop comes aft from the pilot's compartment to help
Hicks dress his injuries. Hicks is sprawled in a flight
seat, the contents of a FIELD MEDICAL KEY strewn around
him. He's out of the game...contorted with pain.
BISHOP
Ripley...
RIPLEY
She's alive. They brought her
here and you know it.
BISHOP
In seventeen minutes this place
will be a cloud of vapor the
size of Nebraska.
Ripley is stuffing gear rapidly into a satchel, her hands
flying.
RIPLEY
Hicks, don't let him leave.
HICKS
(grimacing with
pain)
We ain't going anywhere.
She hefts the hybrid weapon, grabs the satchel and spins
to the door controls. The door opens. Wind and
machine-thunder blast in.
RIPLEY
See you, Hicks.
Hicks is holding a wad of gauze plastered over his face.
HICKS
Dwayne. It's Dwayne.
Ripley grabs his hand. They share a moment, albeit
brief. Mutual respect in the valley of death.
RIPLEY
Ellen.
HICKS
(nods with
satisfaction)
Don't be long, Ellen.
Ripley runs down the ramp, crossing the platform to the
open doors of a LARGE FREIGHT ELEVATOR. The doors close.
INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR 170
The elevator descends. Bars of light move rhythmically
across her as Ripley stands facing the doors, watching
the landings go by. The heat grows more intense. Pipes
glowing cherry-red pass by. Steam hisses and billows.
The lift clatters in a steady beat. Hypnotic.
Ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness
directly over her T-shirt. Her hair is matted, and
she glistens with sweat. Her eyes burn with a
determination that holds the gut-panic in check.
The elevator descends. She checks her weapon. Attaches
a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness. Primes the
flamethrower. Checks the rifle's magazine. Racks the
bolt, chambering the first round. She checks the
MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her
jump pants. She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling,
forcing herself to be strong. We SEE she doesn't
know doodley about grenades.
This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done. She
begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat. Her fingers
slick and slippery on the rifle. The elevator descends.
The lift motors whine, slowing. It hits bottom with a
bump. The safety cage retracts. Slowly, expectantly,
the doors open.
HER P.O.V. THROUGH the parting doors...an empty
corridor. Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow
VISIBLE here and there. It seems to have been a descent
into Dantean Hell. The air itself vibrates with heat
distortion. Couplings groan. Machinery whines and
throbs. Like the beating of a vast heart the pounding
of massive pumps echoes through the station.
INT. CORRIDOR 171
Ripley moves out of the lift, knuckles white on the
rifle. Her eyes dart, straining to penetrate the lethal
gloom. Behind her we SEE a SECOND ELEVATOR next to
hers, its lift cage somewhere on a higher floor. Ahead
the corridor is encrusted with the alien excressence
and not far down the bio-mechanoid catacomb begins.
She enters the maze, darting glances at Hick's LOCATOR,
taped to the top of her kludge weapon.
A VOICE echoes down the tunnels, calm and mechanical.
VOICE
Attention. Emergency. All
personnel must evacuate
immediately. You now have
fourteen minutes to reach
minimum safe distance.
INT. CATACOMB 172
Range and direction read out in rapid-fire alpha-numerics
on the locator display.
Ripley blinks sweat out of her eyes, moving through the
swirling steam of the alien maze. She approaches an
intersecting tunnel. Flashing emergency lights
illuminate the insane fresco of the walls. She spins,
firing the flamethrower. Nothing there. She whirls
back. Moves forward, trembling and adrenalized.
Skeletal figures drown in the walls, frozen in macabre
tormented positions like human insects in amber.
Steam blasts, blinding her. The locator signal
strengthens an she turns, crouches through a low
passage, turns again. At each intersection she quickly
lights a FIFTEEN-MINUTE MARKING FLARE and drops it.
For the way back. She has to turn sideways, inching
through a fissure between two walls of death...cocoon
niches, human bas-relief sealed in resin.
SUDDENLY SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT, GRABBING HER! A hand.
She recovers , then recognizes the face sealed in
the wall. Carter Burke.
BURKE
Ripley...help me. I can feel
it...inside. Oh, God...it's
moving! Oh gooood...
She looks at him. No one deserves this.
RIPLEY
Here.
She hands him a grenade, wrapping his fingers around
the spoon, and pulls the primer. She moves on.
VOICE
You now have eleven minutes to
reach minimum safe distance.
Ripley moves ahead. The locator signals shows she is
almost there. A CONCUSSION rocks the place, like an
earthquake, jarring her almost off her feet. Then
another. The whole station seems to shudder. A SIREN
begins to wail a demented rhythm. Following the tracker
she turns a corner and stops. The RANGE INDICATOR READS
ZERO. She looks down, horrified to see Newt's tracer
bracelet lying on the floor of the tunnel. All hope
recedes, disintegrating into mindless chaos.
INT. EGG CHAMBER 173
Newt is cocooned in a pillarlike structure at the
edge of a cluster of upright OVOID SHAPES...alien
eggs. Her eyelids flutter open and she becomes
aware of her surroundings. The egg nearest her
begins to move...opening like an obscene flower at
its top to reveal something stirring within. Newt
stares, transfixed by terror, as the jointed legs
appear over the lip of the ovoid one by one. She
SCREAMS.
INT. CATACOMBS 174
Ripley hears the scream and breaks into a run.
INT. EGG CHAMBER 175
Newt watches the face-hugger emerge and turn toward
her. Ripley runs in just as it is tensing to leap,
and FIRES, blasting it with a burst from the assault
rifle. The flash illuminates the figure of an
adult warrior, nearby. It spins, moving straight
for Ripley. Firing from the hip she drills it with
two controlled bursts which catapult it back. She
steps toward it, FIRING AGAIN. Her expression is
murderous. AND AGAIN. It spins onto its back.
She unleashes the flamethrower and it vanishes in
a fireball. Ripley runs to Newt and begins tearing
at the fresh resinous cocoon material, freeing the
child. She swings her up onto her back.
NEWT
(weakly)
I knew you'd come.
RIPLEY
Newt, I want you to hang on,
now. Hang on tight.
Groggily Newt hooks her arms and legs through the belts
of Ripley's battle harness as Ripley picks up her
weapon. More warriors are moving toward her among
the eggs. She fires the flamethrower. The eggs are
engulfed. One of the warriors lunges forward, a
living fireball. She blasts it in half with two
bursts from the M-41A. Ripley retreats, ducking under
a glistening cylindrical mass. A PIERCING SHRIEK
fill the chamber. She turns. And there it is.
A massive silhouette in the mist, the ALIEN QUEEN
glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black
insect-Buddha. What's bigger and meaner than the
Alien? His momma. Her fanged head is an unimaginable
horror. Her six limbs, the four arms and two
powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her
distended abdomen. The egg-filled abdomen swells
and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended
from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike
membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped
carelessly among the machinery. Ripley realizes
she ducked under part of it a moment before. Inside
the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless
eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor
where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by
DRONES. The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions
of the ""warrior"" aliens we have already seen.
Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher. She
fires. Pumps and fires again. Four times. The
grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE,
ripping it open from within. Eggs are tons of gelatinous
matter pour across the chamber floor. The Queen goes
berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle.
Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting
everything in sight with an insane fury. Eggs shrivel
in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones
vanish in frenzied thrashing. Over all is the Queen's
shrieking as she struggles in the flames. Two
warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on
her. She pulls the trigger...an empty click. DIGITAL
COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes. She drops the
magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home
and OPENS UP.
The creatures vanish in rapid-fire flashes. Ripley
backs away, venting her terror in a sustained orgy
of fire as she blasts everything that moves in one
long eye-searing expenditure of energy. Then she
dashes into the catacombs, navigating by sheer primal
instinct.
INT. CATACOMBS 176
Ripley runs, blindly, with panting intensity verging
on hysteria. Impressions crash upon her...the maze
blurring by, sirens howling, the station rocking with
explosions, emergency lights flashing, steam blasting,
red-hot steel hissing. Reality itself is reduced to
a concussive series of strobelike instants of
relentless forward motion.
She sees one of the flares she dropped and turns.
Sees another, sprinting toward it as the foundations
of the world shake.
INT. EGG CHAMBER 177
Lashing in a frenzy, the QUEEN DETACHES FROM THE EGG
SAC, ripping away and dragging torn cartilage and
tissue behind it. SEEN DIMLY THROUGH swirling smoke,
it rises on its powerful legs and steps forward.
INT. CATACOMBS - CORRIDOR 178-
179
Ripley uses the flamethrower ahead of her, firing
bursts of pulse-rifle fire down side corridors at
indistinct shapes and shadows. The weapon is empty
when she reaches the freight elevators. A mass of
debris, falling down the shaft from a higher level,
has demolished the life cage she descended in. She
slams the control for the other cage and hears the
sound of the LIFT MOTOR'S WHINE as it begins its
slow descent from several levels up. AN ENRAGED
SCREECH ECHOES in the corridor. Ripley sees a
silhouette moving in the smoke...a glistening black
shape which FILLS THE CORRIDOR TO THE CEILING...THE
QUEEN. Her last cartridge is reading zeroes. The
flamethrower sputters uselessly when she tries that.
The grenades are gone. Ripley drops the weapon and
looks up the shaft to the descending lift...then at
the approaching FIGURE. The elevator won't be in time.
She runs to a ladder set in the wall as a horrendous
screech beats in her ears. She scrambles up the
rungs.
INT. SECOND LEVEL 180
Ripley struggles up through a narrow hatch, Newt
clinging to her. She dives aside as a POWERFUL
BLACK ARM shoots up through the opening, its
razor claws slamming into the grille-floor inches
from her. Looking down through the grille she
sees the great horrifying jaws directly below her,
wet and leering. She scrambles up, running, as
the grille-floor lifts and buckles behind her
with the titanic force of the creature below.
It hurls itself with insane ferocity against the
metal, pacing her from below as she runs.
INT. STAIRWELL 181
Ripley reaches an open-grid emergency stairwell and
sprints upward. It rocks and shudders with the
station's death throes.
VOICE
You now have two minutes
to reach minimum safe
distance.
INT. CORRIDOR - ELEVATORS 182-
183
The lift reaches bottom, the doors rolling open.
The Queen turns and freezes, as if contemplating
the open lift cage.
INT. STAIRWELL 184
Ripley stumbles, smashing her knees against the
metals stairs. As she rises she hears the LIFT
MOTORS start up. Looking down through the lattice
work of the station she sees the life cage start
ominously upward. She knows there is only one
explanation for that. She runs on, the stairwell
becoming a crazy whirl around her.
EXT. LANDING PLATFORM 185
Ripley, with Newt still clinging to her, slams
through the door opening onto the platform.
Through wind-whipped streamers of smoke she
sees...THE SHIP IS GONE.
RIPLEY
BISHOP!
Her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred,
outrage at the final betrayal. She scans the sky.
Nothing.
RIPLEY
(hysterical)
BISHOP!
Newt is sobbing.
The lift rises ponderously INTO VIEW. Ripley turns,
backing away from the doors toward the railing. There
is no place to run to on the platform. EXPLOSIONS
detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs
swell upward through the machinery. The platform bucks
wildly. Nearby a cooling tower collapses with a
THUNDEROUS ROAR and the SHRIEK OF RENDING STEEL. More
EXPLOSIONS, one after another, rocketing up from below.
Ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops. The
safety cage parts.
RIPLEY
(to Newt; low)
Close your eyes, baby.
The lift doors begin to open. A glimpse of the
apparition within.
ANGLE ON RIPLEY AND NEWT as the drop-ship RISES RIGHT
BEHIND THEM, its hovering jets roaring.
VOICE
You now have thirty seconds to
reach...
Ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from
the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship. A
TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE COMPLEX nearby,
slamming the ship sideways. Its extended landing legs
foul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideous
squeal of metal on metal.
INT./EXT. DROP-SHIP - STATION 186-
187
Ripley leaps into a seat with Newt, cradling her. Begins
strapping in. Bishop wrestles with the controls. The
landing legs retract, ripping free. Ripley slams her
seat harness latches home.
RIPLEY
Punch it, Bishop!
The entire lower level of the station disappears in a
fireball. The air vibrates with intense heat waves and
concussion. The drop-ship engines fire. Ripley is
slammed back in her seat. The ship vaults out and up,
Bishop standing it on its tail, pouring on the gees.
Ripley and Newt see everything shake into a blur.
EXT. STRATOSPHERE 188
The drop-ship lunges up and out of the cloud layer into
the clear high night. Below, the clouds light up from
beneath from horizon to horizon.
A SUN HOT DOME OF ENERGY bursts up through the cloud
layer, WHITING OUT THE FRAME. The tiny ship is slammed
by the shockwave, tossed forward...and climbs, scorched
but functioning, toward the stars.
INT. DROP-SHIP 189
Ripley and Newt watch the blinding glare fade away and
they sit, wide-eyed, trembling, realizing they are
finally and truly safe. Newt starts to cry quietly,
and Ripley strokes her hair.
RIPLEY
It's okay, baby. We made it. It's
over.
INT. SULACO CARGO LOCK - IN ORBIT - LATER 190
The scorched and battered ship once again sits in its
drop-bay, steam blasting from cooling vents beside the
engine. Rotating clearance lights sweep the dark chamber
hypnotically.
INT. DROP-SHIP 191
Bishop stands behind Ripley as she kneels beside a
comatose Hicks.
BISHOP
I gave him a shot, for the pain.
We'll need to get a stretcher to
cart him up to medical.
Ripley nods and, picking up Newt, precedes Bishop down
the aisle to the loading ramp.
BISHOP
I'm sorry if I gave you a scare
but that platform was just becoming
too unstable...
INT. CARGO LOCK - DROP-SHIP 192
Bishop continues as they move down the ramp.
BISHOP
I had to circle and hope things
didn't get too rough to take you
off.
Ripley turns to him, stopping partway down the ramp.
She puts her hand on his shoulder.
RIPLEY
You did okay, Bishop.
BISHOP
Well, thanks, I --
He notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the
ramp next to his shoe. SSSSSS. Acid. SOMETHING BURSTS
FROM HIS CHEST, spraying Ripley with milklike android blood.
It is the razor-sharp scorpion TAIL of the alien QUEEN.
Driven right through him from behind. Bishop thrashes,
seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is
slowly lifts him off the deck. Above them the Queen
glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic
mechanisms inside one landing-leg bay. It blends perfectly
with the machinery until it begins to emerge. Seizing
Bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him
aside, shredded, like a doll. It descends slowly to the
deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black
limbs, dripping acid and rage. Still smoking where Ripley
half-fried it. The Queen is huge, powerful...and very
pissed off. It descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in
inhuman geometries.
Ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring
hypnotized...terrified to break and run. She lowers Newt
to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.
RIPLEY
(to Newt)
Go!
Newt runs for cover. The Alien drops to the deck, pivoting
toward the motion. Ripley waves her arms, decoying.
RIPLEY
Here!
Without warning it moves like lightning, straight at her.
Ripley spins, sprinting, as the creature leaps for her.
Its feet slam, echoing, on the deck behind her. She clears
a door. Hits the switch. It WHIRRS closed. BOOM. The
Alien hits a moment later.
INT. DARK CHAMBER 193
Ripley moves ferret-quick among dark, unrecognizable
machines.
VARIOUS ANGLES VERY TIGHT ON what she is doing...her feet
going into stirruplike mechanisms. Velcro straps
fastened over them. Fingers stabbing buttons in a sequence.
Her hand closing on a complex grip-control. The HUM of
powerful motors. The WHINE of hydraulics.
INT. CARGO LOCK 194
The Queen turns its attention from the doors to Newt as
the little girl crawls into a system of trenchlike
service channels which cross the deck. The channels are
covered by steel grillework and barely big enough for her
to crawl through.
INT. CHANNEL 195
Newt scurries like a rabbit as the looming figure of the
Alien appears above, seen through the bars. A section of
grille is ripped away behind her. She scrambles
desperately. Another section is ripped away right at her
heels. Light pouring in. The next will be right above
her.
INT. CARGO LOCK 196
The Queen spins at the sound of door motors behind her.
The parting doors REVEAL an inhuman silhouette standing
there.
Ripley steps out, WEARING TWO TONS OF HARDENED STEEL.
THE POWER LOADER. Like medieval armor with the power of
a bulldozer. She takes a step...the massive foot
CRASH-CLANGS to the deck. She takes another, advancing.
Ripley's expression is one you hope you'll never see...
Hell hath no fury like that of a mother protecting her
child and that primal, murderous rage surges through her
now, banishing all fear.
RIPLEY
Get away from her, you bitch!
The Queen SCREECHES pure lethality and leaps.
WALLOP! A roundhouse from one great hydraulic arm catches
it on its hideous skull and slams it into a wall. It
rebounds into a massive backhand. CRASH! It goes
backward into heavy loading equipment.
RIPLEY
(screaming)
Come on!
The Queen emerges as a blur of rage, lashing with
unbelievable fury. The battle is joined.
Claws swipe, tail lashes. Ripley parries with radical
swipes of the steel forks. They circle in a whirling
blur, demolishing everything in their path. The cavernous
chamber echoes with nightmarish sounds...WHINE, CRASH,
CLANG, SCREECH.
They lock in a death embrace. Ripley closes the forks,
crushing two of the creature's limbs. It lashes and
writhes with incredible fury, coming within inches of her
exposed body. She lifts it off the ground. The hind
legs rip at her, slamming against the safety cage, denting
it in. The striking teeth extend almost a meter from
inside its fanged maw, shooting between the crash-bars.
She ducks and the teeth slam into the seat cushion
behind her dead in a spray of drool. Yellow acid foams
down the hydraulic arms toward her. The creature rips
at high-pressure hoses. Purple hydraulic fluid sprays
...machine blood mixing with alien blood. They topple,
off balance. The Queen pins her. Ripley hits a switch.
The power loader's CUTTING TORCH flares on, directly in
the thing's face. They roll together, over the lip of
a RECTANGULAR PIT, A VERTICAL LOADING AIRLOCK.
INT. LOADING LOCK 197
They crash together four meters below, twisted in the
loader's wreckage. The Alien shrieks, pinned.
Ripley pulls her arm out of the controls of the loader
and claws toward a panel of airlock actuating buttons.
She slaps the red ""INNER DOOR OVERRIDE"" and latches the
""HOLD"" locking-key down. A KLAXON begins to sound. She
hits ""OUTER DOOR OPEN"" and there is a hurricane shriek of
air as the doors on which they are lying separate,
REVEALING the infinite pit of stars, below.
All this time the Alien has been lashing at her in a
frenzy and she has been parrying desperately in the
confined space. The airlock becomes a wind tunnel,
blasting and buffetting her as she struggles to unstrap
from the loader. The air of the vast ship howls past her
into space as she claws her way up a service ladder.
INT. CARGO BAY 198
Newt screams as the hurricane airstream sucks her across
the floor toward the airlock. Bishop, torn virtually in
two, his pastalike internal organs whipped by the wind,
grips a stanchion and reaches desperately for Newt as she
slides past him. He catches her arm and hangs on as she
dangles, doll-like, in the airblast.
INT. LOADING LOCK 199
The Alien seizes Ripley's ankle. She locks her arms
around a ladder rung, feels them almost torn out of
their shoulder sockets.
The door opens farther, all of space yawning below. The
loader tumbles clear, falling away. It drags the Alien,
still clutching one of Ripley's lucky hi-tops, into the
depths of space. Its SHRIEK fades, it gone.
With all her strength Ripley fights the blasting air,
crawling over the lip of the inner doorway. She releases
the OVERRIDE from a second panel. The inner doors close.
The turbulent air eddies and settles.
She lies on her back, drained of all strength. Gasping
for breath. Weakly she turns her head, seeing Bishop
still holding Newt by the arm. Encrusted with his own
vanilla milkshake blood. Bishop gives her a small, grim
smile.
BISHOP
Not bad for a human.
He winks.
Ripley crosses to Newt.
NEWT
(weakly)
Mommy...Mommy?
RIPLEY
Right here, baby. Right here.
Ripley hugs her desperately.
INT. CORRIDOR 200
Ripley limps along the corridor, carrying Newt on her hip.
The ship's systems hum comfortingly. Newt's head rests
on her shoulder.
NEWT
Are we going to sleep now?
RIPLEY
That's right.
NEWT
Can we dream?
RIPLEY
Yes, honey. I think we both can.
HOLD ON THEM AS they recede down the long straight
corridor.
FADE OUT
THE END"

WOODS The Rangers plunge into thick woods. Branches slap at them, but the sound of gunfire keeps them going. Captain Malcolm is still in the lead, flanked by two young men who are obviously brothers. The big, handsome one is COLE YOUNGER; the skinny one with the lopsided hair is BOB YOUNGER. EXT. WOOD'S EDGE They break through the other side of the woods, emerging behind a rickety set of fence-post fortifications. Instantly GUNFIRE tears apart the trees around them. The Captain's horse goes down, and the Younger brothers dive and roll to hide beneath the palisade. The Captain, still alive, has fallen beyond the wooden shield. Cole scrambles through the savage rifle fire, grabs Captain Malcolm, and hauls him behind the fortification. CAPTAIN MALCOLM (bellowing) Fall back into the woods! Out of your saddles before you're shot out of 'em! The Rangers leap from their saddles as a new sound starts -- a dull roar that grows and approaches and BBRRRRAPPPPP as, unbelievably, trees EXPLODE INTO SPLINTERS and horses and men go down in a heap! COLE Gatling! They've got a Gatling! BOB Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago! Some men are crawling to the fortifications, others are staying in the woods. The Captain pokes his head up to take a look. With him WE SEE EXT. ANOTHER HILLSIDE At the top of which, about a hundred fifty yards off, is a three man Gatling crew. Squads of Union soldiers are beginning to make their way down the hillside. And just to their right is an EIGHT INCH CANNON with a burning fuse -- EXT. FORTIFICATIONS CAPTAIN MALCOLM DOWN! BOOM! And with a whistle the cannonball TEARS THROUGH the forest and EXPLODES just behind the Rangers. Some of the men are screaming from injury and panic. CAPTAIN MALCOLM (CONT'D) Cole! Bob! You boys okay? COLE Hell, take more than a cannon to kill the Younger brothers, sir! BOB I think the cannon's doing a pretty good job, Cole. A full-blooded Indian, COMANCHE TOM, crawls up next to them. COLE Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom. COMANCHE TOM You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are. ANOTHER ROUND from the Gatling chews up the trees and fencing, driving their heads down. CAPTAIN MALCOLM They're using the Gatling and the cannon to cover their advance. We're pinned unless we take them out! Cole peers through the rails. COLE Those gunners are too far away... CAPTAIN MALCOLM Get me the James boy. COMANCHE TOM You want Jesse? CAPTAIN MALCOLM Not Jesse, the one who can shoot. Comanche Tom rolls back to the edge of the woods. COMANCHE TOM FRANK! EXT. WOODS - A FEW YARDS BACK Among the squatting men a single one STANDS UP. FRANK JAMES is tall with a dark, thoughtful face. He looks sadder than his 23 years should allow. His hand is wrapped around a longbarrel Enfield 30. FRANK Jesse. The long rider behind him turns around. He's JESSE JAMES, 20. He's too damn good-looking and he's got your best friend's eyes. There's a coiled energy to him, and right now he seems more angry than afraid. Next to him is WEB MIMMS, 15, who is terrified and trying not to show it. FRANK (CONT'D) Watch Web. WEB I don't need watchin'! JESSE Web, I bring you back dead and your sister'll kill me. Now shut up and lie there. (then) Careful, Frank. And make sure Bob and Cole are okay. EXT. FORTIFICATIONS Loose shots spitting up dirt and wood chips everywhere. Frank crawls up, nods to the Youngers, peers through the stacked wood. Another EXPLOSION from the cannon. FRANK Cannon or Gatling? COLE Both would be nice. FRANK Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up. CAPTAIN MALCOLM Cannon. Frank raises his head just high enough to poke the Enfield over the stacked fenceposts. Everyone else is flinching from the suppressing fire. Frank is perfectly still. Squinting, aiming, perfectly centered ... BANG. CUT TO: EXT. CANNON STATION As the Captain of the six man crew SNAPS BACK and hits the ground dead. Before the others can react, two more grab their throats and drop. The remaining soldiers bolt from the cannon. But the Gatling crew swings the gun around and the barrels BLAZE. CUT TO: EXT. FORTIFICATIONS Frank and the others hit the dirt as the Gatling shreds the fenceposts, fells trees, churns the ground, stitching a path of destruction across the bulwarks and into the woods where EXT. WOODS The Gatling rounds are everywhere. Rangers jerk as the Gatling tears them apart. Jesse grabs Web to his chest and swings around, shielding the boy with his own body. When the fire pauses for a moment. Jesse looks down -- he's covered in blood. He lets Web fall away. Blood bubbles up from where the boy's chest used to be. JESSE Hell no... Jesse's trying to stop the blood with his bare hands. WEB Aw, Jesse. (crying) I never even got to be with a girl. Web dies. Jesse sighs. He's seen too much death to cry anymore. He stands up, pivots, and strides for the fencepost barrier. Rifle fire is zipping through the air all around him, but he keeps walking. EXT. FORTIFICATIONS Frank, the Younger brothers, Comanche Tom and the Captain are all still there. Captain Malcolm peers through the wall. CAPTAIN MALCOLM They're getting closer. Jesse arrives, slaps Cole's shoulder. Cole grins grimly. COLE 'Bout time you got here, buddy. JESSE What's going on? FRANK Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off. JESSE So we got a plan? BOB My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine, thank you. FRANK I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction. JESSE (smiling) A distraction? Well, why the hell didn't you just say so? Jesse sprints back into the woods. Cole, Bob, and Frank exchange looks. BOB He's smiling. COLE Never a good thing. FRANK This ought to be interesting. ANOTHER ROAR from the Gatling pushes their heads down, but as that sound fades, another blends in, growing louder and louder, the SOUND OF HOOFBEATS ANGLE ON The men at the fortification, turning to face the woods, their faces stunned as JESSE JAMES ON HORSEBACK AT FULL GALLOP EXPLODES from the woods, heading straight at his own men and at the last second LEAPS OVER THE BARRIER, and as he does Jesse leans back in the saddle to let the wind strip off his longrider coat, revealing for the first time his GUNS -- two Colts at the hip, a crossed bandolier on his chest with two cross-holstered Colts at the shoulders, and two Colts in the small of his back. And for that one second as Jesse and the horse are in mid-air and the longrider coat trails behind him like leather wings and his guns gleam blue in the sunlight, Jesse James is the Angel of Death. EXT. HILLSIDE The horse hits the ground running. The Union troops are in shock as Jesse draws both his hip Colts and starts firing. JESSE Come on, ya Yankee bastards! His GUNS BLAZING, Jesse rides straight at the Bluecoats. Five, six are down before they can even react. They start firing back, but they can't draw a bead. Two more are down. Jesse's making every bullet count. ANGLE ON The Gatling gun as the crew swings it around and FIRES, hundred of rounds tearing straight at Jesse ANGLE ON Jesse who incredibly cuts the horse hard left using just his knees, still shooting as the Gatling volley goes wide, actually killing two of the Union soldiers behind Jesse. But then the arc of fire takes Jesse's horse in the rump. The horse falls, but Jesse dives off, still firing, killing another two soldiers. Then he hits the ground, rolls, and is up and running, dropping the spent Colts and drawing the two shoulder guns in one smooth motion, never interrupting his shooting. EXT. FORTIFICATIONS Frank sees the Gatling swing away from him. He stands and -- EXT. HILLSIDE -- BANG as the Gatling triggerman drops, BANG as the ammo-feeder goes down, and BANG as the third man falls before the echo of the first shot clears. EXT. FORTIFICATIONS Cole is the first one on his feet. COLE WAAAHHHHOOOO!! We're coming Jesse! CAPTAIN MALCOLM Charge! With a ragged cheer the RANGERS ERUPT FROM THE FOREST, some actually on horseback, firing at the exposed Union troops. EXT. HILLSIDE Soldiers are swarming Jesse, but he's moving, turning, an untouchable blur in the chaos. As he drops two more empty Colts and reaches for the last two at his back, a SOLDIER just an arm's length away BRINGS UP A RIFLE. JESSE Oh, you do not! Jesse grabs the rifle barrel and drives the butt straight back into the soldier's nose. The Union boy falls, releasing the gun. Jesse swings the rifle in a smooth arc, bashing another soldier in the jaw, and then spins it effortlessly into his opposite hand and FIRES it point blank into another Union soldier. ANGLE ON The Rangers PLOWING INTO the Union soldiers. Rattled, the Union troops are beginning to break and fall back. ANGLE ON Jesse as another nearby soldier draws a revolver. Jesse snags his hand, twists it, wrapping the man's arm backward around Jesse's waist. With the other man still gripping the weapon, Jesse FANS THE HAMMER as he turns, shooting six more Union soldiers as they try to rush him. With a final yank, Jesse pulls the Colt from the man and crashes it down on his skull. ANGLE ON the Union soldiers in full retreat. EXT. THE GATLING STATION The few remaining Bluecoats break and run as Jesse reaches the Gatling. Suddenly a FIGURE LEAPS UP from behind the Gatling and FIRES his rifle. A bloody streak tears Jesse's cheek and he stumbles onto his back. With a cry, the figure jumps forward and buries his bayonet in Jesse's chest! Jesse gasps, then, puzzled, looks down. The bayonet has lodged right in the ""X"" of the ammo belts on his chest, stopped by the bullets and leather. Jesse kicks. As the Union soldier is knocked back, Jesse smoothly snap-kicks to his feet and draws both remaining Colts. He pulls up short. It's a fifteen year old boy, Web Mimms in a blue uniform. There's a deadly pause. JESSE You ain't even been with a girl, have you? The boy shakes his head. Jesse waves him off with the guns. JESSE (CONT'D) Git. The boy scurries off. Jesse turns and lopes down the hill. Instantly he's surrounded by cheering Missouri Rangers. EXT. HILLSIDE The Rangers move past Jesse. Jesse suddenly realizes Frank is there. They fall into step together. JESSE Distracting enough for you? FRANK Pff. They hardly even noticed you. JESSE So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention. FRANK Mm-hmm. JESSE Such as? FRANK You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats. JESSE That would have made an impression. FRANK I figure. JESSE See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it. FRANK No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out. Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom RIDE UP on their recovered horses. Cole jumps down and picks up Jesse in a bear hug. COLE Wait'll we get back to Missouri, start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself! COMANCHE TOM You ride like a Comanche. BOB You can ride like that? COMANCHE TOM I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche. Cole mounts up, reaches down a hand to Jesse. COLE Ride with me, cousin? JESSE I could use the walk. COLE Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road. (then) Let's ride, Rangers! Cole slaps leather and the Rangers canter off. As they disappear we hear: BOB (low) Now, I would just sound stupid saying something like that... Jesse and Frank watch them go, then start walking again. JESSE (finally) Web's dead. FRANK I reckoned. JESSE Hell of a war. FRANK I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time. EXT. ROAD - DUSK The James brothers, the Youngers, and the other Rangers ride down a dirt road toward a ragtag column of Confederate soldiers. The grey uniforms are ghostlike in the twilight. The men are obviously broken, dispirited. The column stretches down the road and around a bend as far as the eye can see. Jesse and the other Rangers ride into the midst of the Confederates who part and flow around the horsemen like a slow-moving river. For a moment, nobody speaks while the whole eerie procession glides past. COLE Where you boys going? JESSE There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em. One grizzled Confederate VETERAN, his arm in a bloody sling, looks up at Jesse. VETERAN War's over, son. General Lee surrendered yesterday at Appomattox. The soldiers move on. The Rangers stare into the middle distance of despair. Cole rubs his hands across his face. FRANK Yesterday. BOB Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES! COLE What do we do now? Jesse seems to be the only one with a clear head. JESSE Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there, and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again. BOB (pause) Best damn plan I heard all war. Jesse jerks his reins, and the last remaining survivors of the Missouri Rangers trot off into the sunset. MONTAGE -- Jesse, Frank, the Youngers and Comanche Tom riding hard down country roads, past burned out farms. THE RIDERS Are struggling through a downpour in a pitch black night, one of the horses slipping, going down. BLAZING SUN On a dusty road, the Youngers sharing a horse now, everybody just trying to keep moving. EXT. HILLTOP - DAY Jesse, Frank, Cole, Bob, and Comanche Tom are looking down on the frontier town of Liberty, Missouri. FRANK Hello, Liberty Missoura! JESSE All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm, I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle. COLE Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty. BOB Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty. JESSE Home, boys. Back to our farms. COLE Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year. BOB Corn gonna shoot at me? FRANK Nope. BOB Then I love it. They start to ride down into town. COLE Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want. COMANCHE TOM Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you... COLE Well? COMANCHE TOM I'm thinking... Cole throws a playful punch at Comanche Tom. EXT. LIBERTY STREET - DAY The gang is riding into the main stretch of town. They're grinning, happy to be home, until -- JESSE We got problems. DOZENS OF UNION SOLDIERS are walking along the boardwalk, lingering near the saloon, all suddenly staring at the riders. COLE What the -- FRANK Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys. Cole is returning stares. JESSE Hands off your hip, Cole. COLE You're not scared, are you? JESSE Pick your fights, cousin. You taught me that. BOB It gets worse. There in the center of town, is a brand new scaffold. Three bodies, fresh ones, are hanging from the nooses. FRANK Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ... BOB ... Will Perry ... COLE They rode with Quantrill's Rangers. The riders stop at the scaffold, take off their hats. JESSE Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got. FRANK We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here. COLE I'm cutting them down. Cole starts to dismount. Jesse grabs his arm. The Union Soldiers have started to form a crowd JESSE Not now. COLE What is wrong with you? JESSE (low) In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming. Cole thinks, nods. They ride away from the scaffold. BOB Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay. FRANK Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms. The Youngers and Comanche Tom split off, start to trot away. COMANCHE TOM I think I may just go on to the reservation. BOB Tom, I'm this close to coming with you... EXT. MIMMS HOME - DAY Jesse and Frank ride toward a handsome white two-story frame house that stands in a grove of elm trees. ANOTHER ANGLE They dismount and walk up to the porch. A FARM HAND in a cowboy hat is nailing a rail onto the porch. JESSE Scuse me, we're here for the Doctor. The farm hand turns and pulls off his hat -- her hat. She's a chestnut-haired beauty in her late teens, ZERELDA MIMMS. ZEE Jesse! Frank! She hugs both of them enthusiastically. Jesse is obviously, immediately smitten. JESSE Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms? ZEE You were little Jesse James when you left. JESSE But you got big! Zee arches an eyebrow. JESSE (CONT'D) I mean, you aged -- Zee arches both eyebrows. JESSE (CONT'D) I mean, I mean, in a good way you got big and older. Zee tilts her head. Jesse's mouth moves, but nothing comes out, until JESSE (CONT'D) Frank, don't you have something to say? FRANK You're doing just fine. JESSE (pulling it together) Zee, we got to talk to you and your father. DOC MIMMS, a grey-haired man wearing rimless spectacles, steps out of the doorway. DOC MIMMS Frank, Jesse. (looking) Where's Web? ANGLE ON A LONG SHOT of the Mimms house. We can see, but not hear, Jesse talking. A beat, then we hear Zee CRY OUT. Doc Mimms staggers, SLUMPS DOWN in the door frame. Jesse and Frank rush to help him. DISSOLVE TO: INT. PARLOR - A WHILE LATER The room is comfortable and elegant in a simple way. Doc Mimms is slumped in a big chair. Zee, her eyes red, is pushing a glass of sherry into his hands. Jesse and Frank sit across from him. JESSE -- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee. DOC MIMMS My little Web did that? JESSE Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads, killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them. Jesse looks at Frank, urging him on. FRANK Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself. JESSE Saved all our lives, Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms, Doc. God's honest truth. Doc is fighting back tears, but proud. DOC MIMMS Web died fighting? JESSE Died a hero. ZEE (quietly) But still died. JESSE If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help. DOC MIMMS Start thinking about yourselves. You, the Youngers, Clell Miller, all of you. Don't end up like Charlie. They found out Charlie rode with Quantrill's Raiders. They arrested him, tried him by military tribunal and hanged him this morning. FRANK I thought there was general amnesty. DOC MIMMS For soldiers, yes. But if you rode in one of the partisan bands, they'll hang you for treason. And you boys are in more danger, because you've got a farm. Jesse and Frank don't understand. ZEE Daddy, don't start with this again. DOC MIMMS Zerelda, it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through, offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason? FRANK You're saying the railroad's got the Army doing it's dirty work? DOC MIMMS Rich men in Washington, don't matter if they wear a tie or a uniform, they're all the same. JESSE All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me. FRANK Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right. JESSE What kind of story are they going to believe? ZEE Hmm. You were in the Confederate Army with General Hood's Texas Army until... say Sharpsburg, then you were reassigned to General Jeb Stuart's cavalry until you surrendered in Tennessee. Pause. The men stare at Zee. Up goes the eyebrow again. JESSE That just might work. FRANK Maybe, maybe... DOC MIMMS Now go on to see your Ma. She'll be glad to see her sons alive. (choking) And for her sake, stay that way. EXT. MIMMS HOME - MINUTES LATER We see Frank and Jesse mount up. Zee is at the door seeing them off. FRANK We'll be back on Saturday with Cole and Bob, give you a hand with the repairs. ZEE Thank you. For everything. Especially that story you told my father. Jesse is about to object, but Zee raises a hand. ZEE (CONT'D) I'm going to go cry now, so I don't have time for your lies. But I'll see you Saturday. Zee kisses her fingertips and extends them to the boys, then disappears into the house. CLOSE ON: Frank shaking his head as they ride away. FRANK That Zerelda turned into a hell of a woman, eh -- WIDEN TO REVEAL Jesse's not next to him. Frank turns. Jesse's still staring at the door. Frank rides back, takes Jesse's horse by the reins. As Frank turns Jesse's horse and leads it away, Jesse's head keeps pivoting, fixed on the door. After a moment, Jesse turns to look forward, taking his reins. The brothers ride away slowly. FRANK (CONT'D) ""Big and older""? JESSE You can shut up now. FRANK You are a charmer. JESSE I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep. FRANK Next time try ""fat and haggard."" Jesse pulls down his hat and groans into it. EXT. JAMES FARM - DAY Jesse and Frank ride up. Out of the farmhouse bursts MA JAMES, a big, rugged frontier woman who is absolutely hysterical. MA My boys! My boys! She hauls Jesse and Frank clean out of their saddles. MA (CONT'D) My boys are alive! FRANK (strangling) Not if you don't ease up a bit, Ma... She looks at both at arm's length. MA Did you kill Yankees? JESSE A fair number, Ma. MA Say your prayers? FRANK Every night, Ma. MA Good. Now get inside and wash up for dinner. INT. JAMES HOME Jesse and Frank enter, surprised to find Cole, Bob, Comanche Tom, and a gawky 15 year old JIM YOUNGER all eating at their kitchen table. FRANK Well look at Jimmy Younger. You're all grown up. JIM (mouth full) Mmmph-hmpph. BOB (sheepishly) Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something. COLE That was two hours ago. MA I don't see clean plates. The men dutifully return to the meal. Jesse nods his head at Comanche Tom. JESSE (quiet) Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend. MA He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy. Ma WALKS OFF. FRANK She's still talking to Jesus. JESSE What worries me is that Jesus is talking back. EXT. JAMES FARM We can hear the laughter from inside the lit house. Night falls and DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JAMES FARM - DAY - A FEW WEEKS LATER Like a time-lapse film we see the surrounding trees have filled out, the stone fence is repaired, the shabby paint redone in sparkling white. Jesse and Cole, shirtless, are driving a post into a hole. Frank STEPS OUT of the house and joins them. JESSE You ever notice Zerelda's eyes? COLE She got two of them. FRANK I think one of 'em's glass. COLE Which one, right or left? FRANK The brown one. JESSE (to Cole) You talk big for a man who screwed another man back in Atlanta. Frank laughs as Cole raises the shovel to strike Jesse. FRANK Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's... COLE Sadie was not a man! JESSE She had a moustache. COLE She was European! JESSE All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman -- Jesse and Frank swallow their laughs. JESSE (CONT'D) -- if you stop saying things about my Zee. FRANK Your Zee? Hmm. (quoting) ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."" COLE I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice. FRANK Shakespeare. (pause) He's European. COLE Ah. JESSE You want to write that down for me so I can say it to Zee? The post finally drops straight into the hole. Jesse and Cole shrug into shirts and grab a pitcher of lemonade. JESSE (CONT'D) Thanks for the help. COLE After all you did on our farm? (sips, then) You miss it, don't you Jesse? JESSE The war? What, are you crazy? (beat) There are things I miss about it. COLE It was exciting. JESSE But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that? COLE Because we were good at it? Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns. JESSE (regretful, but not) Yeah. Frank looks at Jesse thoughtfully. Then all three notice ANGLE ON A BUGGY that stops at the edge of the property. Ma STEPS OUT onto the porch next to Frank to meet: A man in a suit, ROLLIN PARKER, and three riders who dismount and flank Parker: two DETECTIVES and a big Scot with a beard and no moustache, ALAN PINKERTON. Pinkerton is wearing a suit and a gun in a high waistband. All four advance to the house. PARKER Howdy, folks. How are you this afternoon? COLE ""Howdy""? JESSE Easterners. MA We're just fine, thank you, sir. PARKER I am Rollin H. Parker, personal emissary of Mr. Thaddeus Rains, president of the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. These two gentlemen are Pinkerton detectives, working for Mr. Thaddeus Rains, president of the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, and this gentleman here is the famous Alan Pinkerton, founder of the Secret Service and now working under contract to Mr. Thaddeus Rains. JESSE Would that be Thaddeus Rains, president of the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad? FRANK You know him? JESSE Heard of him. PARKER (trying to regain control) As you have no doubt heard from your neighbors, our railroad is moving west. JESSE That makes sense, as east would put you underwater. Pinkerton coughs a laugh. Parker glares at him and continues. PARKER ... moving west, opening the frontier for folks such as yourself. Your acreage here is on the proposed right of way. Parker produces a piece of paper. Ma takes it. PARKER (CONT'D) I'm here for your signature on this land sales contract. I'm authorized to pay you two dollars an acre. MA Two dollars? PARKER That's right. That's the price authorized by the railroad's board, and approved by the Department of the Interior of the Government of the United States of America. MA This land ain't for sale. Pinkerton steps forward. PINKERTON Ma'am, I can understand how you might feel that way -- you've made a lovely home here. But it's really not up to me or you. Are you familiar with the legal concept of the Right of Eminent Domain? FRANK Yeah, I am. What about it? Parker is surprised. Pinkerton has become interested in these farmers. PINKERTON Well, this land is about to be condemned. PARKER I'm doing you folks a favor -- COLE Said the skinner to the mule. PARKER -- with a price of two dollars an acre for this one time only offer. After today the price goes down. So if I were you, I'd just sign the contract, and I'll be on my way. Frank takes the contract from Ma and hands it back to Parker. FRANK Good day, Mr. Parker You can tell Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where the sun don't shine. (to the boys) Shakespeare. JESSE/COLE Ah. Parker flushes with anger. Pinkerton and his men rest their hands on their guns. PINKERTON I don't think you understand. You don't have a choice. CLICK CLICK and we see Jesse's drawn and cocked two Colts from out of thin air. Frank has pulled his rifle from the doorway. Parker and the detectives are furious, but Pinkerton seems no more than curious. PARKER (to Ma) Ma'am. You have to look in your heart and do what you know is right here. MA Let me ask the Lord. Ma bows her head for a moment. She then nods and looks up. MA (CONT'D) The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them. JESSE Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today. FRANK Why don't we just let them go for today, Ma. We'll bury them out back next time. MA Oh all right. Parker, and the detectives are stepping backward to the buggy. PARKER You people are making a serious mistake! Pinkerton himself has lingered, taking in the group. PINKERTON (nodding) Nicely played. Parker, Pinkerton and the detectives RIDE OFF. The group at the James house watches them go, then Cole turns to Jesse. COLE Where the hell did you get those guns? OFF JESSE'S SHRUG WE DISSOLVE TO: INT. SCHOOL HOUSE - NIGHT Dozens of men and a few women are packed into the one room school house. Among them are Frank and Jesse. Doc Mimms is leading the meeting. FRANK I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land, they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can. JESSE Damn. All that reading paid off. DOC MIMMS Floor recognizes Clell Miller. CLELL MILLER, tall and blond, steps forward. CLELL They're saying we don't sell, we might end up with nothing! FRANK That's only if we don't stick together. DOC MIMMS (pointing) Loni Packwood. LONI PACKWOOD, a sad, scruffy man stands up. LONI I say this is the last straw. I came back from the war, I found my house burned down. My cows was dead. Now my wife's run off with my cousin, Jeb, that sonofabitch. (tearing up) Took my dog-- DOC MIMMS Ah, Loni, about the railroad. LONI I forget. (almost weeping) Took my dog... Another FARMER steps up. FARMER I signed. FRANK Harlan, you can't. FARMER I'm tired of fighting. I'm just gonna take my family and move west. CLELL Maybe we should hire a lawyer. FARMER 2 That's a good idea! FRANK It would be, if the courts were on the up and up. CLELL So what do we do? ANGLE ON the school house door as it BANGS open and Bob Younger STUMBLES IN, bleeding from a cut on his forehead, being supported by Zee. BOB They got Cole. He collapses into a seat. The crowd surrounds him. ZEE He came to our house, Daddy. I figured you'd all want to hear this. Jesse and Frank are next to Bob. Zee puts a hand on Jesse's shoulder. He notices. BOB They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper. FRANK (rubbing his forehead) Oh no... BOB He just lost his temper a little. JESSE (sighing) How many of them did he kill? BOB Two. FRANK Damn! BOB They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior -- FRANK The Army can hang him. BOB Tomorrow. CLELL What do we do? JESSE Nothing. The crowd stares at Jesse. JESSE (CONT'D) You folks are going to do nothing. You're all going to go home right now. So you're going to be able to swear on a Bible that you don't know anything about what's going to happen tomorrow. Jesse's gaze is at once noble and terrifying. The crowd quietly begins to disperse. DOC MIMMS Boys... JESSE Go home, Doc. (softly) They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys. Doc Mimms nods, EXITS. Jesse walks to the other end of the school house. Bob, Frank, Clell and Loni fall in behind him. The door SWINGS OPEN again and Comanche Tom enters with Jim Younger sporting six-guns way too big for him. COMANCHE TOM I couldn't lose him. BOB Jim Younger, I told you-- JIM It's my fault they're gonna hang Cole. I want in. FRANK Jim, it was just a matter of time before they tried to hang somebody else to scare off the other farmers. JESSE And you're too young. JIM (to Jesse) I'm the same age you were when you went off to war. JESSE And the same age Web was. No. ZEE (O.S.) (O.S.) You're wasting time. Zee joins them. JESSE Zee, go home. Zee's eyebrows go up. ZEE Who else was there when they hanged the others? The men look at each other. Nothing. ZEE (CONT'D) You need to know how they do it. Which way they walk up. What order they do things in. And if you mess up rescuing Cole because you won't listen to a woman, then God damn you all. Pause. JESSE All right. Seven of us against a Union regiment and Pinkerton detectives in broad daylight in the middle of Main Street. Jesse smiles. BOB He's smiling. JIM Is that bad? FRANK Very. EXT. LIBERTY CITY GALLOWS - THE NEXT DAY Soldiers flank the gallows, which stand at the bottom of the stairs to City Hall. A small drum corps beats a stark rhythm. Parker is watching this like a sideshow. Pinkerton is next to him, scanning the crowd of locals which is getting larger and surlier by the minute. PARKER Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate. PINKERTON It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case. Pinkerton WAVES to a FIGURE in a suit atop the water tower. CUT TO: EXT. WATER TOWER We see it is FRANK JAMES in the suit, who WAVES BACK and then kneels and sights down his long rifle. Tucked away behind him, out of sight from the street, is a bound-and-gagged PINKERTON SNIPER in his underwear. CUT TO: EXT. GALLOWS Cole, his face swollen from a beating, is marched up the stairs of the gallows toward the waiting hangman. LONG SHOT of the gallows, detectives and soldiers down the street on both sides, guns ready. The position is completely unassailable. Cole is at the platform. His hands are tied in front of him. The noose is placed on his neck. BACK TO The gallows. Parker leans forward in anticipation. A UNION LIEUTENANT approaches with the black hood. Cole spits in his face. The CROWD ROARS. The Lieutenant angrily motions to the HANGMAN, who grabs the lever -- The drums STOP -- But the drumming doesn't. The drum corps look at each other, confused. The Army men and the Pinkertons squint in concentration. There's definitely some sort of rhythmic DRUMMING, coming closer... The CROWD, sensing something, easing back from the gallows... The drumming gets LOUDER ... EXT. STREET REVEAL Fifty-odd CATTLE suddenly STAMPEDING from down the street, their hooves creating the drumming! REACTION SHOTS as the Pinkertons and Army men start to scatter, the cattle surging around them -- EXT. VIEWING STAND ANGLE ON Parker and Alan Pinkerton running for cover, Pinkerton half-turned to watch the action. PINKERTON Brilliant... Pinkerton suddenly spots something confusing. We FOLLOW his stare to see -- ANGLE ON a HORSE in the middle of the cattle, cutting through the steer, towards the gallows. THE HANGMAN REACHES FOR THE LEVER AGAIN, BUT JUST AS HE DOES - Jesse -- masked -- appears from the side of the horse, where he's been hanging on Indian-style. He gets a leg up on the horse's back and LEAPS -- SLAMMING into the Hangman, bringing him down! The cattle pass the gallows, revealing that the tight ranks of the Army and Pinkertons are now spread out -- EXT. GENERAL STORE SMASH! From the nearby GENERAL STORE, the other masked rescuers CRASH through the big front window on horseback and ride into the Army men, FIRING AWAY. TOTAL CHAOS! The Army men and Pinkertons fight towards the gallows. As Jesse untangles himself from the Hangman, the Union Lieutenant reaches for the lever but BANG drops as Frank opens fire. Frank starts picking off soldiers. The detectives and remaining soldiers are completely disoriented. EXT. GALLOWS Jesse flashes a knife and the noose drops away from Cole's neck. Facing Cole, he cuts the rope on Cole's wrists -- Cole instantly draws Jesse's guns from his waist holster, spin-reverses them and SHOOTS two Union soldiers climbing the stairs behind Jesse's back. Jesse and Cole exchange a look, then Jesse steps away -- As Bob rides by he TOSSES JESSE'S GUNBELT into the air. Jesse draws both guns from the belt as it flies by, spins and starts shooting. EXT. MAIN STREET The soldiers have totally broken ranks. One riderless horse led by Comanche Tom pulls up by the scaffold. Jesse LEAPS ON and Cole jumps on behind him. Jesse puts the spurs to it and the horse SURGES into a gap in the crowd. Allen Pinkerton steps past the panicking troops, squarely in the path of the charging horse. He draws his gun and FIRES. The bullet PLOWS into Jesse just as the terrified horse lurches forward, TRAMPLING Pinkerton. Cole holds Jesse up and the riders take off down the street. We see Frank has disappeared from the water tower. The soldiers fire at the fleeing liberators. One of the detectives runs over to the injured Alan Pinkerton. DETECTIVE Sir, are you all right? (shout) Somebody get a doctor! EXT. MIMMS HOME - NIGHT WE SEE one window upstairs with a light on. INT. BEDROOM Doc Mimms has just finished bandaging Jesse, who lies unconscious beneath the sheets. Zee is holding an oil lamp. ZEE He's going to be fine, right Daddy? DOC MIMMS The bullet came out clean, but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt. The SOUND OF HOOFBEATS APPROACHES from outside. INT. LIVING ROOM Doc Mimms opens the door. A UNION OFFICER and a squad of soldiers push in. OFFICER Good evening, sir, we're looking for a fugitive. DOC MIMMS A fugitive? Who? OFFICER We don't know, but he was very badly wounded. We're checking all the houses in the area. INT. BEDROOM Zee hears her father protesting, then FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Quickly she undresses, grabs a quilt from a chest and jumps into bed with Jesse. She pulls the quilt up to her neck, completely hiding him. At that moment, the Officer barges in. Zee lets out a little gasp as if startled awake. She covers herself with the quilt. ZEE Sir! Who are you? OFFICER Oh. Sorry ma'am. ZEE I should hope so. The Officer EXITS. Zee watches the door for a moment, then looks down fondly at Jesse. ZEE (CONT'D) Jesse, are you awake? JESSE (groggy) Mmmm. Zee gently pushes his hair off his face. Then her expression changes. ZEE Jesse, is that your hand? JESSE Nuh-huh ... Jesse smiles in his sleep. Zee jumps out of the bed and wraps a dressing gown around herself. Doc Mimms enters. DOC MIMMS They're gone. What are you -- ZEE I fooled them into thinking I was alone. DOC MIMMS Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning. ZEE (with a little smile) I think he's already feeling better. A puzzled Doc Mimms follows her out. EXT. LIBERTY MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON - TWO WEEKS LATER A lavishly appointed carriage rolls up to the front of the nicest hotel in town. Rollin Parker and his retinue of Pinkerton detectives scurry to the door. The DOOR OPENS. Out steps THADDEUS RAINS, wearing an elegant suit he bought in London last year and a scowl he picked up in Boston three decades ago. The scowl fits him better. PARKER Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field. RAINS And it is my pleasure to be here. PARKER Really! RAINS NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen! PARKER I can completely understand your distress, sir. Rains sighs. As he speaks, he checks a heavy, gold, ornate and ever-present POCKETWATCH on a GOLD CHAIN. RAINS Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order. PARKER Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers. RAINS Good. PARKER Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident. RAINS Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers. PARKER (puffing with pride) Yes sir. RAINS Just perfect. PARKER A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers. RAINS You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity. PARKER I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight. RAINS I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress. EXT. MIMMS HOME - AFTERNOON - THAT SAME DAY Zee is on the porch. Jesse COMES THROUGH the door, moving gingerly. Zee immediately moves to support him. ZEE You shouldn't be up. JESSE I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it. ZEE You're sick of my company? JESSE No! I mean, of course not. No. ZEE Teasing you is completely unfair. JESSE What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean. ZEE I shouldn't tease a hero. JESSE What? ZEE Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero. JESSE I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day. ZEE So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger? JESSE Unfair. You are completely unfair. They look at each other warmly. Frank DRIVES UP in a carriage. FRANK You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming? JESSE What do you think? FRANK Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself, she's gonna make me miserable. Doc Mimms COMES OUT onto the porch. JESSE What do you say, sir? DOC MIMMS Go on. You're pretty much all healed up. Jesse and Zee exchange glances. Zee withdraws demurely into the house. Jesse straightens up and hops easily into the carriage. FRANK You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody -- JESSE (to Frank) Shut up. (to Doc Mimms) Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by? DOC MIMMS You know you're welcome any time! JESSE (unusually awkward) Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here. (beat) But out. DOC MIMMS (bemused) It's fine by me, Jesse. FRANK Don't worry, sir, I'll make sure they're always properly chaperoned. Jesse slooooowly turns to glare at Frank. DOC MIMMS (grinning) Why, that hadn't even occurred to me, Frank. I am deeply in your debt. FRANK Army's leaving town, so Cole can stop hiding up in the woods and come back to his farm. Everybody's getting together at the Younger place for a to-do. Frank tips his hat, and the carriage MOVES OFF. EXT. BARNYARD - NIGHT Dozens of people are milling about happily in the lantern light of a Western party. Some are dancing to the small banjo-led band. A small knot of men are comparing war stories. Cole Younger is wandering among them, people clapping his shoulder, shaking his hand. Jesse -- formally accompanying Zee -- and Frank arrive at the edge of the light. Immediately the entire group bursts into applause and crowds Jesse. Cole cuts through and bear hugs Jesse, making him wince. COLE Here's Liberty's favorite son! (quietly) I'll never forget what you did, cousin. BOB Zee, I'm pleased you came. ZEE Why thank you, Bob. BOB I'm especially pleased you came with Jesse. (off her look) Seeing as right now there's a gaggle of girls hoping to dance with Jesse who are just going to have to settle for the many charms of Bob Younger. ANGLE ON A group of obviously disappointed, beautiful young women. Bob runs a hand through his hair. JESSE You have no shame. BOB Not yet. But I'm hoping. The party starts up again, and everyone is caught up in the good times. ANGLE ON Jesse SWINGING Zee into a group of dancers. They join in the Two-Step, and Jesse's as smooth as silk. EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT - A WHILE LATER Jesse, carrying a lantern, and Zee are walking. We can hear the party still going just a little ways away. They reach a tree at the hilltop with a beautiful view of the stars and the river. They sit down, their backs against the tree. JESSE I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older. ZEE You didn't want to farm? JESSE I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate. ZEE A river pirate. JESSE Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy. ZEE Thank God you grew out of that. (pause) You did grow out of that, didn't you? JESSE Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor. ZEE You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James? JESSE Not if I find the right girl. ZEE And what's this right girl like? JESSE Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth. ZEE Where will you find such a girl? JESSE Honestly, you'd do if only you had the buck teeth. Zee fakes a monstrous overbite. JESSE (CONT'D) (dreamy) Finally. The two move a little closer. Eye contact. JESSE (CONT'D) Ahem. ""From this doctrine..."" No, ah... ""From women's eyes this doctrine I derive, they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."" ZEE Sparkling rocks? JESSE Little ones. ZEE Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote? JESSE Yep. ZEE Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting? JESSE I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time. They kiss. It's everything it should be. BOOM! Jesse and Zee are startled by a flash of light and sound. They turn to look back -- EXT. YOUNGER BARN The partygoers are RUNNING from the YARD to the BARN, which is ON FIRE in several different places. As the Younger brothers and Frank get close, they see a squad of masked riders disappearing down the road. Some of the men SHOOT at the riders, but the distance is too great. Jim makes a run for the BARN, but Bob grabs him. COLE BASTARDS! Come back here and face me! FRANK Get buckets! Some of the crowd starts to form a bucket line to the well. Jesse and Zee RUN UP. Frank turns to him. FRANK (CONT'D) Pinkertons. It's the railroad. JESSE Ma. Frank and Jesse bolt for their horses, swing into the saddles and GALLOP OFF. EXT. JAMES HOUSE From a bit down the road, looking just fine. Jesse and Frank reign in as relief rushes across their faces -- AN EXPLOSION tears the house apart like a pile of matchsticks! Jesse and Frank urge their horses into a full gallop. EXT. YARD Jesse and Frank leap from their mounts, trying to get close to the house. The flames are too strong. JESSE Ma! Ma! Jesse's ventured so close his coat catches fire. Frank tears it from him and stamps it out. Jesse ignores him, still pacing back and forth in front of the inferno. JESSE (CONT'D) Ma! Please! MA (O.S.) (O.S.) (weakly) Boys? The brothers turn and nearly drop from shock. Ma is stumbling toward them, half her hair singed off, brutally BURNED. FRANK Jesus mercy -- They reach her just as she collapses. Jesse is cradling her, Frank with his arms around both of them. MA Riders -- JESSE We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms. MA Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers. Jesse is openly crying. Frank has tears silently streaming down his face. JESSE Doc Mimms will -- MA Shush. Ma's eyes turn up, and she half-smiles. MA (CONT'D) Well look at that. The Good Lord's a bit shorter than I reckoned. Ma gently stops breathing. ANGLE ON The boys holding Ma, framed by the roaring flames of their home. Jesse leans his head back and lets out a HOWL OF RAGE AND PAIN AND HATE that goes on and on and on... DISSOLVE TO: EXT. JAMES FARM - MORNING Frank and Jesse are staring at the smoking ruins of their lives. Other townsfolk are milling nearby, including Zee and the Youngers. FRANK ... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else. JESSE Don't care. FRANK Didn't think you would. (turning away) I'm going to go make the coffin. JESSE Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through. Frank is gone. COLE Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy Johnston, the Creeders. Will Hite. BOB The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys. COLE I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men. JIM I like that. JESSE No. They stare at him. JESSE (CONT'D) This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day. COLE (snapping) So what do we do, General Lee? JESSE Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care. BOB But if we take their money and supplies... JESSE Exactly. JIM That's a great plan, Jesse! Cole nods grudgingly. BOB I'll get us a few more men, and Comanche Tom'll ride with us. JIM Where do we hit first, Jesse? COLE I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money. JESSE Perfect, Cole. COLE Let's ride. The Youngers mount up. Jesse walks to the ruined house, pulls a big iron trunk from the wreckage. He KICKS it open, reaches in, and pulls out his gun belts. Zee appears behind him in what remains of the doorway. ZEE I am so sorry, Jesse. JESSE Frank and me have to go away for a while. Zee considers this, puts her head in close to Jesse's. ZEE You and I, we've started... something, you know? (Jesse nods) I don't know what'll happen if you do this. JESSE Me neither. ZEE Let the law -- JESSE Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does. ZEE Whose justice? Yours or God's? (no answer) When will you stop? JESSE When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes. Jesse kisses her gently, turns and walks to where the Youngers are standing. Zee can barely conceal her anger and heartbreak. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FIDELITY BANK AND TRUST - DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT of a Midwestern bank on a quiet street. INT. FIDELITY BANK There are two teller windows, a couple of male customers and a MOTHER and CHILD. Jesse and Cole ENTER dressed for the trail, longrider coats and spurs. Saddlebags are slung over their shoulders. JESSE Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but I have bad news. The railroad payroll has been stolen. The BANK MANAGER steps out from behind his desk. MANAGER What are you talking about? The railroad's money is right over there in that safe. Jesse draws two guns, Cole produces a shotgun from his coat. JESSE That safe? MANAGER Ah. EXT. FIDELITY BANK Frank James, Bob and Jim Younger, Clell Miller, Loni Packwood, Comanche Tom and several new GANG MEMBERS wait along both sides of the street in this medium sized mid-western town. Some are standing next to their horses, some mounted. ANOTHER ANGLE An OLD MAN with a cane is walking shakily towards the bank. Frank jerks his head and Jim intercepts him. JIM Hold on there, sir. Bank's closed today. OLD MAN Wha? JIM Bank holiday! Bank's closed! Jim tries to steer the old man away. The old man starts batting at him with the cane. OLD MAN Get off me! JIM Ow! Ow! Frank sighs. INT. FIDELITY BANK Jesse and the Bank Manager are having a staredown. MANAGER This is outrageous. Who are you people? JESSE The James Gang. COLE (annoyed) The James-Younger Gang. JESSE Sorry. COLE Don't let it happen again. EXT. FIDELITY BANK The old man is still smacking Jim with the cane. Bob crosses to help. BOB Sir, it's a bank holiday -- SMACK SMACK and now the old man's laying the cane on both Bob and Jim. JIM Ow! BOB Ow ow! Frank hangs his head. INT. FIDELITY BANK Cole turns to the Woman and Child. COLE Ma'am, kindly cover that child's eyes. WOMAN Why? COLE I don't want her to see me shoot this man. The woman covers the child's eyes. Cole raises the shotgun. Jesse half covers his eyes and turns his head. The Manager swallows. EXT. FIDELITY BANK Comanche Tom walks over to where the old man is still SMACKING Jim and Bob. OLD MAN I know it ain't no durned bank holiday! COMANCHE TOM You're right, sir. OLD MAN Then why can't I go in there? COMANCHE TOM On account of we're robbing it. OLD MAN Oh. Why didn't you just say so? COMANCHE TOM It's a secret. OLD MAN Fine. I'll just wait here. COMANCHE TOM I'd appreciate that. The old man settles against the wall. Comanche Tom moves back to his horse. Bob and Jim walk off, glaring at the old man. INT. SHERRIFF'S OFFICE A lean, middle-aged SHERRIFF is walking by his window. His DEPUTY is whittling at the desk. The Sherriff pulls up short. SHERRIFF What the -- DEPUTY What is it? SHERRIFF Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank. DEPUTY So? SHERRIFF When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody? He takes in the group of riders, reaches for his rifle. EXT. FIDELITY BANK Jesse and Cole RUN FROM the bank with full saddlebags. Everybody MOUNTS UP and starts riding down main street. FRANK How'd it go in there? JESSE Fine. How'd it go out here? FRANK We're gonna have to talk... BANG! The gang flinches as a chunk of wood splinters from a post. They turn to see the Sherriff running out in front of them, raising his rifle -- The entire Gang draws their guns. Jesse raises a hand. JESSE Sir, you can do this the smart way, or the stupid way. Only one way ends with you still breathin'. The Sherriff takes in the Gang's firepower. He lowers the rifle. JESSE (CONT'D) (to the Gang) Just 'cause we're robbing a bank, no reason not to be civil about it. The Gang turns and RIDES OFF hard. The DEPUTY walks up to the Sherriff a beat later. SHERRIFF Where the hell were you? DEPUTY I had you covered. (beat) From back there. SHERRIFF Shit. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CAMP - NIGHT A bonfire burns in the middle of a rough camp in the woods. The Gang members are sitting around, relaxing and drinking coffee. All eyes are on Jesse and Cole as they finish counting the money. JESSE I got seven thousand. COLE I got three. BOB Ten thousand dollars! That's almost a thousand apiece! The men HOOT AND HOLLER. LONI My luck is changing at last! Cole holds up a pile of papers. COLE These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad. BOB Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em. Cole goes to hand the papers to Bob and ""accidentally"" drops them in the fire. The men CHEER again. JESSE All right, settle down. All this money ain't ours. BOB Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it. (to Frank) You explain it to him. JESSE We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there. CLELL None of them risked their necks for this. FRANK Now, let's think about this. We create some good will with the folks hereabouts, make it easier to dodge the law. JESSE See, Frank's being smart about this. COLE Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart. BOB Uhh, yeah it does. COLE You stay out of this, Bob. JIM I think Jesse's got a good idea -- COLE You stay out of this too, Jim. (to Jesse) Who put you in charge of this gang, anyway, Jesse? I did mighty fine leading us during the War. JESSE And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck -- FRANK And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together, right? Jesse and Cole nod, still watching each other. FRANK (CONT'D) Two heads are better than one. All Jesse was doing was making a suggestion. Jesse nods, his face giving nothing up. FRANK (CONT'D) So we're waiting to hear what you think of the suggestion. As the other leader of the gang. Cole considers this. COLE I reckon it's the smart thing to do. The other Gang members grumble. Cole whirls on them. COLE (CONT'D) Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think -- FRANK Strategically. COLE -- Exactly. Because this is a war. CLELL This ain't no war. The Gang is taken aback by this blatant contradiction. Then a smile spreads across Clell's face. CLELL (CONT'D) Nobody paid me no thousand dollars to fight in the War! The Gang LAUGHS, and the tension is broken. Jesse and Cole slap each other's shoulders, and everyone starts counting their money and talking all at once. INT. SALOON - DAY The crowded saloon is alive with music, card-playing, and dancing girls. Various James Gang members are playing cards and drinking. Jesse, Cole, and Frank are at the bar. COLE It's not a bank. JESSE It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job. FRANK And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives. JESSE And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives. Jesse and Cole grin and slap each other on the back. Jim BURSTS in waving a newspaper. He quickly runs to the bar. JIM (stage whispering) We're famous! Jesse takes the paper. JESSE I'll be damned! The other Gang members drift over to the bar. JESSE (CONT'D) (reading) ""The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."" COLE Twenty?! LONI What are the odds, another gang robbing the same place right after we did. BOB Yeah, Loni, that's exactly what happened. JESSE ""The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."" BOB Hey! JESSE ""Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."" CLELL We only got ten thousand. COMANCHE TOM This happens all the time when you let the white man count the money. JESSE ""The U.S. District Marshal at St. Louis called this the first daylight bank robbery in American history."" Jim whistles. JIM We made history. That's something to be proud of. COLE The rest of this is all lies. JESSE That just means the next time, we'll have to set the record straight ourselves. The Gang looks at him. EXT. THAXTON SWITCH DEPOT - NIGHT Half finished railroad tracks run alongside a few sheds and an office building. ANGLE ON The TRAIN TRACKS as the James-Younger Gang rides at full gallop. A rapid series of SEQUENTIAL EXPLOSIONS follows them, destroying the track for hundreds of yards. EXT. THAXTON SWITCH DEPOT - MORNING The entire work camp is DESTROYED. SMOKE still hangs over the twisted wreckage, a few wagons smolder, it looks like Omaha Beach at D-DAY plus 20. Thaddeus Rains is surveying the damage with Parker. PARKER They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile. RAINS How much did they get from the safe? PARKER Thirty-five thousand, sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track -- RAINS I'll kill them for blowing up my railway! PARKER To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks. RAINS THEN WHO DID?! PARKER We did. Rains stares at him. Parker swallows. PARKER (CONT'D) ... I mean, our men. Our own workers planted the dynamite. (beat) They were under duress. Rains controls his cerebral hemorrhage through sheer force of will. He checks his pocket watch, then says through gritted teeth: RAINS Where the hell is Pinkerton? The SOUND OF HORSES makes them turn. ANGLE ON A fancy carriage that pulls up. WE SEE the ground beneath the carriage. A boot hits the ground. Then another. Then the tip of a cane. REVEAL Alan Pinkerton now moving toward Rains and Parker, limping from when Jesse's horse trampled him. He has a newspaper folded up under one arm. RAINS (CONT'D) Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least. PINKERTON (surveying) Not to mention my men who lost their lives. PARKER Your men knew the risks. RAINS What is going on here, man? PINKERTON My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time. PARKER They had to be dealt with! PINKERTON By burning down their homes? RAINS You wouldn't have done that? PINKERTON Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too. RAINS I want them arrested and hanged! PINKERTON Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains. RAINS This is no game. PINKERTON I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree. He hands Rains the paper. Rains' eyes bug out. He begins to read aloud. RAINS (reading) ""A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis, Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives, but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."" PINKERTON It is a nice piece of writing. RAINS ""The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction, meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"" (he slams the paper into Parker's chest) Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month! PINKERTON Oh, that's the best part. He points Rains to the bottom of the article. RAINS ""The foregoing article was sent to the newspaper. It was reputedly written by the outlaw -- (exploding) Jesse James himself!"" Rains crushes the paper in his hands, raging as he surveys his destroyed rail tracks. CUT TO: INT. MIMMS HOME - DAY Doc Mimms is reading a paper to Zee. DOC MIMMS ""...written by the outlaw Jesse James himself."" Zee is pacing. ZEE He thinks this is some kind of game! DOC MIMMS I'm upset too, Zee, but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck. Zee looks at him. Doc Mimms sighs. DOC MIMMS (CONT'D) I know. But the Lord protects madmen and prophets, and Jesse's...one of them. I'm just not sure which. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - DAY A freight train is coming. We can see ""Rock Island and Pacific Railroad"" written across the side. INT. ENGINE CAB The ENGINEER nudges the fireman. ENGINEER Look at that. Outside, along the railbed, members of the James Gang are holding a series of signs, each one a dozen yards after the other. The engineer reads each one as they pass. ENGINEER (CONT'D) (reading) ""Better... slow... down... dynamite... ahead... too late... you're dead!"" The engineer and the fireman look up. Ahead of them on the track is an overloaded wagon with barrels marked ""TNT"". The engineer slams on the brakes. The high pitched scream of steel on steel sounds out over the avalanche of sparks flying from the wheels. EXT. TRAIN TRACKS The train stops juuuuust in time. The front of the engine is inches away from the wagon. INT. ENGINE Jesse sticks his head in, guns drawn. JESSE That was a fine piece of driving, yes sir. He looks at the wagon. The engineer and fireman follow his gaze. EXT. TRAIN TRACKS Comanche Tom and Jim Younger climb on top of the wagon, kick over some barrels. They're empty, without even a top or bottom. INT. ENGINE Jesse grins as the engineer and fireman hang their heads. INT. BANK - DAY Jesse and Frank walk into a large bank dressed in suits. Just inside the door, Frank notices something odd and nudges Jesse. It's a ""Wanted"" poster. ""Frank and Jesse James. $5,000 reward."" They look back and forth at the artist's sketches and each other. They shake their heads ""no."" Jesse walks over to the teller's window. He hands a bill to the TELLER. JESSE Could you change this please? TELLER (studying it) Sir, this bill is counterfeit! Jesse draws. Frank whistles and Cole, Bob and Jim burst in. JESSE I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare? FRANK It's the scientific method. It's all the rage. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY IN a richly paneled conference room, a group of BANKERS, POLITICIANS and RAILROAD OFFICIALS are gathered around a large table. On the table is a map with a dozen red markers. Thaddeus Rains and Alan Pinkerton are studying the map. RAINS Senator, can't you do anything? A Missouri SENATOR shakes his head. SENATOR The people see the James-Younger Gang as heroes against the Eastern businessmen. This is not an area where men in suits are much loved. RAINS Pinkerton, why can't you get these outlaws? PINKERTON It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns. RAINS I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers! PINKERTON Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create. RAINS So you can't tell me anything? PINKERTON It's going to be a long winter. Rains pounds the table. MONTAGE: VARIOUS SHOTS -- THE GANG On horseback, firing back at a posse. -- THE GANG RIDES THROUGH A FIELD Where dozens of sharecroppers are sweating away. They leave a wake of twenty dollar gold certificates fluttering in the furrows and hanging in the corn. -- PINKERTON, LEADING TWENTY DETECTIVES, RIDING HARD up to a crossroad. With a wave of his hand, never stopping, he splits one group off to head East, and he and the others head West. WALL OF ""WANTED"" POSTERS Marked the ""James-Younger Gang."" The James brothers and Younger brothers nod at the likenesses, which are getting better. All except Bob, who stares at his in disbelief. It looks nothing like him. Jesse tears down his poster and autographs it for a young boy. EXT. OPEN RANGE The Gang is riding hard. Cole and Jesse look over their shoulders, nod to each other, and WHISTLE. The men bring their horses down to an easy pace. JIM I never thought that posse was gonna give up. FRANK They were admirably persistent. COLE Jesse, we got to have a word. JESSE Sure, cousin. COLE All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the ""James-Younger Gang."" JESSE Yep. COLE Why aren't we the ""Younger-James Gang""? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here. JIM I kinda like the sound of the James-Younger Gang. COLE (bristling) Whose side you on? BOB No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing. COLE How? BOB Say we bust into a bank. We yell ""We're the Younger-James Gang!"" People are gonna be thinking, ""The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?"" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms. JESSE Can't argue with that. Cole rolls his eyes. COLE I think you boys are missing the point here... They continue to argue as they ride off. JIM How about ""James-Younger"" for the bank jobs and ""Younger-James"" for the train robberies? BOB See, that's even more confusing, people'll think there's two gangs... EXT. WESTERN STREET - DAY Comanche Tom RIDES UP to the building marked Marshall's Office. A MARSHALL and a dozen PINKERTON DETECTIVES are sitting around the porch. Tom leaps off his horse. COMANCHE TOM You 'um big lawman? MARSHALL Yeah, Injun. What do you want? COMANCHE TOM Great Chief of St. Louis send me. MARSHALL The District Marshall MARSHALL (CONT'D) Of St. Louis? COMANCHE TOM Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun, above Great River, near Eagle Rock. MARSHALL East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass? COMANCHE TOM Ho-yah! The Marshall turns to his men. MARSHALL I want every man in town! We can cut off Jesse James before he crosses out of my territory! Let's go! The posse quickly mounts up. The Marshall tosses Comanche Tom a coin. MARSHALL (CONT'D) Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk! COMANCHE TOM Me get heap firewater -- The posse RIDES OFF. COMANCHE TOM (CONT'D) -- you cretins. Comanche Tom flips the coin over his shoulder. From around the corner THUNDERS the James Gang. They ride up to the building marked ""Bank"" right next to the Marshall's office. The Gang dismounts, runs in. An improbably short time later, the Gang members run back out with full saddlebags and mount up. Comanche Tom RIDES OFF with them. FRANK Nice performance, Tom. COMANCHE TOM I feel dirty. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - MONTHS LATER The same men in suits and the same map, only now with more red markers on it. In the center of the group are Thaddeus Rains, Rollin Parker and Alan Pinkerton. RAINS Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses. PINKERTON All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who, quite frankly, are no match for this group's cunning. PARKER What about your detectives? They haven't -- Pinkerton suddenly CLOSES on Rains and Parker. Rains doesn't back down, but we are acutely aware of the fact that Alan Pinkerton is a big, violent Scotsman. He never raises his voice here, but then again -- he doesn't have to. PINKERTON (to Parker) First of all: you, shut up. (to Rains) Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs. RAINS I can't believe this. PINKERTON And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly, as heroes. PARKER How can that be? PINKERTON They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school. RAINS With my money! PARKER We should go burn that school to the ground, sir! PINKERTON (dryly) Yes, that's the way to win the locals back to our side. RAINS I demand action. PINKERTON No, you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results, you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course, (jerking his head at Parker) You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it? RAINS Can't you tell me anything? PINKERTON It's going to be a long spring. MONTAGE: VARIOUS SHOTS -- THE GANG RIDES ALONGSIDE A PAYROLL COACH, The COACH is marked with the ""Rock Northern Railroad"" logo. Suddenly Pinkerton guards leap up from hiding places in the coach and start firing! The gang fires back dropping two of the men. BANK WINDOW Old ""Wanted"" posters are replaced by a new set. THE COACH IS STOPPED Jesse and Frank are pulling the payroll off as the rest of the Gang keeps their guns on the remaining Pinkertons. Two dead Pinkertons lie on the ground. JESSE See, that's a shame. If people would just hand over the money and not shoot at us -- Loni looks at something in his hand. BOB What's that? LONI Lucky Rabbit's foot. Took it off that dead fella over there. BOB I don't think that one's working, Loni. Loni pockets the charm. -- JESSE, FRANK, AND THE YOUNGER BROTHERS Sit heads bowed in a small country church as the collection plate is passed. Jesse drops in a handful of twenty dollar gold pieces. -- A GROUP OF BOYS SWARM AROUND JESSE, Getting him to autograph his ""WANTED! $10,000 REWARD DEAD OR ALIVE!"" Poster. The Gang is all there, admiring the new posters. The likenesses are remarkable -- except for Bob's. It still looks nothing like him. And we can see Cole is not pleased at all the attention Jesse's getting. -- PINKERTON IN THE BOARD ROOM WITH HIS MAP, Directing his lieutenants on how to cover the territory. -- THE GANG CAROUSING IN A SALOON. Jesse is off to one side, writing a letter on fancy stationery. Frank is coaching him. AT THE MIMMS HOME, Doc Mimms hands Zee the envelope we just saw Jesse working with. Zee takes the envelope and tosses it into the burning fireplace. INT. WHITTLY BANK - DAY Jesse, Cole, Frank, and Bob are in the middle of a stick-up. All the BANK PATRONS have their hands up. JESSE Okay, folks, I think we know how this is going to go... BOB One false move and I'll blow your heads off! Jesse, Frank, and Cole look at Bob. JESSE Beg pardon? BOB You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get! Jesse and Cole turn to the HEAD TELLER. JESSE 'Scuse us. HEAD TELLER Think nothing of it. Jesse and Cole cross to Bob. COLE We got a problem here, brother? BOB (low) Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out. JESSE (sighing) This is about the ""Wanted!"" Posters, isn't it. BOB Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies. COLE (to Jesse) This is your fault for hogging all the publicity. JESSE Hold on, hold on, we all know Bob is an important part of the gang. Frank arrives. FRANK Gents, we are in the middle of something here. JESSE Bob's upset. FRANK The posters? JESSE/COLE Yeah. BOB Don't say ""yeah"" in that voice. This is important. Frank, Jesse, and Cole exchange looks. They turn back to the now puzzled crowd. FRANK Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control! JESSE Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang. HEAD TELLER Better than you, Jesse? JESSE Bob Younger taught me how to shoot! The crowd MURMURS APPRECIATIVELY. FRANK Now, we would like to get back to the robbery. HEAD TELLER Of course. The Head Teller starts filling a saddlebag with money. Bob glares at a few people, then nods at Jesse. Jesse winks back. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SALOON - NIGHT The place is alive with song, gambling, and the money the James Gang is dropping. At one table, Loni Packwood lays down his poker hand. As the other players moan, he rakes in the pot. CLELL Damn, Loni, you're lucky. LONI Luckiest man in the West, now that I'm riding with Jesse James! He raises his lucky rabbit's foot in toast to Jesse, who is at the bar nursing a bottle of whisky with Frank. ANGLE ON Jesse and Frank at the bar. JESSE This has been a good year. FRANK Jesse, we're outlaws. JESSE And we're good at it. FRANK It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now. JESSE You've killed your fair share of men. FRANK If I could go back to farming -- JESSE That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen. FRANK I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way. JESSE We're doing this for Ma. FRANK Maybe it started out that way. But now... JESSE What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming. FRANK A better life than the one you could have had with Zee? Jesse HURLS the whisky bottle against the wall. At the CRASH the saloon falls silent. Every eye turns to the James boys. Frank stands up. FRANK (CONT'D) I'll bet you every dollar we've stolen that she hasn't read a single one of the letters you've sent her. Jesse is boiling. His hand twitches. FRANK (CONT'D) You going to throw down on me, Jesse? Jesse's jaw is grinding. JESSE Don't do this, Frank. You know I love you. Frank nods, embraces his brother. The saloon noise STARTS UP again. Frank steps away. FRANK We're drunk. JESSE Oh yeah. FRANK Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad. Jesse nods and Frank EXITS. Jim Younger, also drunk, steps up. JIM You okay, Jesse? JESSE Yeah. Hey, are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky. JIM Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink. JESSE (jolted) I guess so. JIM I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn. Jesse takes this in silently. JESSE Jim, you been with a girl yet? JIM Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm. Jesse raises an eyebrow. JIM (CONT'D) Well, not exactly. JESSE You been with a girl ever? JIM (insulted) Hell yeah! I been with... (sighs) Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know? JESSE I think so. JIM You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother. (then) Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse? JESSE I swear. JIM (whispering) Tell you something else. (belches) I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up. JESSE You do that. Jim stumbles away and OUT THE DOOR. We hear him THROWING UP ENERGETICALLY a moment later. Jesse thinks for a moment, beckons over the bartender. INT. SALOON - A FEW MINUTES LATER Jim stumbles back in. A pretty young woman, LYLA, approaches him. LYLA Excuse me. Are you Jim Younger? Jim pulls himself together. JIM Why, yeah. LYLA I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name. JIM (crestfallen) Oh, you were talking to Jesse. LYLA Yes, but just so I could find out who you were. Jim brightens. JIM Really? LYLA I hope I'm not being too forward. JIM Not at all. LYLA I just though you were awful cute. JIM Thank you, Miss -- ? LYLA Lyla Devereux. JIM Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink? LYLA Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here. JIM (trying to stay smooth) Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk? LYLA That is so gentlemanly of you. As they head to the bar, WE SEE Jesse slide some money to the bartender. JIM (crossing) Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once. LYLA Really? JIM Don't talk about it much, though. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM Parker is leading Rains into the room. Rains SNAPS SHUT his ever-present Pocketwatch. PARKER The final route for the railroad is complete. RAINS I look forward to seeing it. A group of RAILROAD MEN wait around, wearing forced smiles. Parker shows Rains the map. REVEAL the wall-sized map of the United States. The plainly marked RAIL LINE extends due west from New York, through Philadelphia, a straight shot west -- -- until it reaches Missouri, where it takes a painfully obvious swing in a large semi-circle south of the state, then swings up again and continues due west. Rains takes this in. Parker and the railroad men are trying to look casual. RAINS (CONT'D) Parker. PARKER Sir? RAINS What is that? PARKER What, sir? Suddenly, viciously, Rains GRABS PARKER BY THE NECK and SLAMS his face against the map. RAINS (calmly) That. PARKER (strangled) Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain. Rains drops Parker, who slides to the floor stunned. He turns to JENKINS, who is suddenly in an open area cleared by the retreating railroad men. JENKINS Sir. RAINS Jenkins. JENKINS We've done a financial study of the construction costs projected into -- RAINS Jenkins. JENKINS It's cheaper to go around Jesse James, sir. Even with the detour and the extra track. It's just cheaper. Rains turns to look at the map. RAINS So he's won. PINKERTON (O.S.) (O.S.) No. ANGLE ON The entire group looking at a serene Pinkerton staring at the James Gang tracking map, which is now festooned with red markers. PINKERTON (CONT'D) Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends. RAINS In English, Pinkerton. PINKERTON There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed. RAINS Can you put men at all four? PINKERTON No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank. RAINS What is that? PINKERTON (smiling) Why, their intense hatred of you, of course. The room holds its breath. Rains begins to smile back. EXT. WESTERN TOWN - EVENING A populous town with the fanciest SALOON we've seen yet. EXT. SALOON - SIDEWALK - EVENING Out on a sidewalk, Jesse stands alone at the edge of the building. He's holding an envelope. HIS POV reveals the address: ""Miss Zerelda Mimms, Liberty, Missouri."" BACK TO SHOT as Jesse reaches up to the street lantern and lights the envelope on fire. He drops it to the ground and watches it smolder. Bob Younger walks up, holding a ""Wanted"" poster. BOB Finally. Jesse looks, grins. The sketch is a dead ringer for Bob. BOB (CONT'D) The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here... JESSE You are a fine figure of a man. BOB Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem. (off his look) It's Cole. JESSE He's been full of vinegar lately. BOB He's planning a job. JESSE What? BOB Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble... JESSE Tell me. INT. SALOON - GAMBLING ROOM Back in a semiprivate card room, Cole is talking to the rest of the Gang. COLE It'll be the biggest score yet. JESSE (O.S.) (O.S.) What will be? Jesse and Frank step from the shadows. Cole tosses them a newspaper. COLE Hyperion Bank, two day's ride from Liberty. They've got a hundred thousand dollars in railroad money just sitting there. Jesse tosses the paper aside. JESSE Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper. COLE If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems. JESSE What are you saying? COLE I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job. JESSE You're forgetting who's in charge -- FRANK (calming him) Jesse. COLE Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride? FRANK Cole, he didn't mean that. JESSE You taking sides against me, now, Frank? FRANK No, I -- COLE So being with me is being against you? Well, we don't want to do that! None of us poor idiots want to go up against the famous Jesse James, greatest outlaw who ever lived! Jesse glares at Cole. The Gang is murmuring amongst themselves. COLE (CONT'D) That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick. BOB What? Clell Miller leans forward. CLELL You have got mighty full of yourself lately, Jesse. JESSE You think so. You all do? (to Frank) You? Frank hesitates a half-second too long. JESSE (CONT'D) (spitting) Beautiful. COLE Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea -- JESSE A bad idea. COLE I got us through the War all right. JESSE And almost got hanged in peacetime. COLE That's it. Cole LUNGES for Jesse, and in a flash they're streetfighting, all elbows and knees and rib punches, GRUNTING and SWEARING. Frank and Bob try to break it up, but it's too fierce. COMANCHE TOM Let them fight it out. The poison needs to leave the wound, to heal. Jesse lands a ROUNDHOUSE, knocking Cole away. Cole goes for his gun, and in a blur they've both DRAWN and stand facing each other with cocked six-guns. The Gang watches in stunned silence. BOB This is healing? COMANCHE TOM Sometimes a wound will kill. BOB Now you tell us. FRANK (edging in) Boys, we don't want this. Neither Jesse nor Cole will back down. They circle, still keeping their guns up. COLE (gritted teeth) I'm the better soldier, Jesse. JESSE And I'm the better outlaw. Jim steps up. JIM And you both hate the railroad. That's what's important. We do this job, and Thaddeus Rains won't dare come West again. Jesse's gaze slides to Jim. JESSE What about that Rock Island bastard? JIM It's his money. He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse? Jesse and Cole stare at each other again. JESSE Still smells fishy. COLE Then let me run the show, General Lee. Jesse thumbs down the hammer of his Colt. Cole does the same. The entire Gang breathes out as one. JESSE Fine. We hit this bank. COLE You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin. (to Gang) Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich! The Gang CHEERS. Frank watches Jesse cross to the WINDOW and sag against it, exhausted. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. HYPERION BANK - DAY The James Gang rides up to the bank. A WATER TOWER can be seen behind the building opposite the bank. Jesse, Cole and Frank dismount and move swiftly to the bank doors. Comanche Tom, Jim Younger, Clell Miller and Loni Packwood dismount and take defensive positions. The few other Gang members stay on their horses, looking sharp. ANGLE ON Cole holds up at the door, produces his shotgun. Frank and Jesse draw six guns. On Cole's lead, they KICK OPEN THE DOORS AND RUSH IN. INT. HYPERION BANK Cole and the James brothers stride in. COLE Nobody move! This is a robbery! The dozen or so farmers and tellers raise their hands. EXT. HYPERION BANK Loni is whistling away, rubbing his lucky rabbit's foot. He squints up at the sun, turns, then stops. He slowly turns back... HIS POV reveals a dozen men APPEARING at the edge of the opposite rooftop, aiming rifles... Loni lets his rabbit's foot drop... The FIRST GUNSHOTS PLOW INTO LONI! As he falls back, we see the rabbit's foot hit the dusty ground... The Gang leaps for cover as a HAIL OF BULLETS begins to tear up the bank face around them. INT. HYPERION BANK Jesse, Frank and Cole whirl to face the door. COLE What the -- JESSE'S POV in a mirror by the door reveals all twelve of the men in the bank drawing guns, shotguns, one rifle -- Jesse shoves Cole and Frank down. He KICKS a stool at the man with the rifle, dives right and ROLLS across a big oak desk. The men begin to FIRE. As BULLETS PING around him, Jesse FIRES from between his legs as he rolls across the desk. The assassins start to drop. Jesse completes his roll at a railing separating the manager's area from the bank floor. In one smooth move he's up and RUNNING ALONG THE RAILING, defying gravity, drawing his shoulder Colts and shooting... The gunmen are crossing into each other's line of fire, Jesse's movement confusing them. Jesse's killed another five, only four left, but he's out of railing and -- CRASH! Through a teller's cage, disappearing behind the counter. The gunmen turn and BLAST the wooden counter, some screaming in panic. CLICKS are heard as hammers fall on empty magazines. The gunmen stare at where Jesse disappeared, panting heavily. CLICK. They forgot about Cole and Frank. EXT. HYPERION BANK The Gang is scrambling for cover. Loni's body lies in the street, his rabbit's foot lying in a pool of his blood. The Gang is returning fire, hiding behind water troughs, dead horses, barely staying alive. The ROAR OF GUNFIRE is deafening. COMANCHE TOM Head for the end of the street! JIM Look! At both ends of the street, WAGONS ROLL into position, each manned by two armed Pinkertons. The Gang is trapped. INT. HYPERION BANK A shot of the open, empty VAULT. COLE Dammit! JESSE (O.S.) (O.S.) A trap. Cole turns. Jesse is moving the surviving cowboys into the Vault. As the last one steps in, Jesse SLAMS the door closed. WE HEAR MORE GUNFIRE. Frank runs in from the back of the bank. FRANK Another dozen out back. COLE They gonna rush us? FRANK They're just insurance in case we run. Jesse crosses to the front door. EXT. HYPERION BANK Jesse sticks his head out the door. JESSE Get inside, you -- Gunfire chews up the doorframe. Jesse pulls back inside. INT. HYPERION BANK Frank and Cole are shooting through the windows. JESSE They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door. FRANK Got any ideas, little brother? Jesse thinks, then smiles. FRANK (CONT'D) Oh Lord. EXT. HYPERION BANK Jesse comes CRASHING through a window! He rolls to a stop next to one of the horses, grabs a saddlebag, then -- to the disbelief of the Gang -- he pivots and CRASHES right back into the Bank! INT. HYPERION BANK Jesse stumbles to his feet, yanks open the bag. Sticks of dynamite tumble out. FRANK/COLE Oh Lord. EXT. HYPERION BANK WE PAN across the trapped Gang, still under fire, to the front of the next door Saloon, and then WE ZIP INT. SALOON Where wary patrons have taken cover from the gunfire. Suddenly -- BOOOM! One wall EXPLODES into dust! In the hole we see the interior of the Bank and -- Jesse James running through, already readying another stick of dynamite -- EXT. ROOFTOP Where the Pinkerton gunmen are shooting at the Gang. Some of the gunmen look curiously as the windows to the building two doors down from the bank BLOW OUT. EXT. STREET As the two Pinkerton detectives at the wagon barricade turn in shock as Jesse James LEAPS FROM THE SECOND FLOOR of a building he can't possibly be in, lands on the wagon, rolls off and DASHES INTO a blacksmith shop across the street. They suddenly notice a HISS. They stand, look in the wagon. Jesse left a burning stick of dynamite in the wagon. ANGLE ON the wagon EXPLODING into matchsticks. INT. BLACKSMITH SHOP The blacksmith is gone, but there's a fire in the FORGE. Jesse leaps and KICKS OVER the forge -- ANGLE ON The white-hot coals IGNITING everything. EXT. ROOFTOP The Pinkertons firing on the gang notice SMOKE rising from below them. They look down ... REVEAL bellowing FLAMES and SMOKE enveloping the entire row of buildings below them. BACK TO The roof as a PINKERTON COMMANDER runs to ledge and looks at the rising flames himself. A HUGE EXPLOSION is heard O.C. A large SHADOW creeps over the snipers. They turn and look up -- -- at the Water Tower TOPPLING towards them! The Pinkertons dive out of the way as the tower SMASHES onto the roof, unleashing a TIDAL WAVE of water! EXT. STREET UPSHOT of the sniper's ledge as the Pinkertons leap off, followed by a WALL OF WATER -- WIDEN to see the water POURING into the building from above -- Cowboys FLY out the windows, followed by TORRENTS of water -- One Pinkerton SWEPT UP and carried off the roof, BOUNCES off a second floor balcony and lands in a puddle on the dirt street below. FOLLOW the water rushing across the dirt street to the feet of -- EXT. HYPERION BANK Jim, Tom and the Gang staring in disbelief at the total destruction Jesse has wrought. EXT. STREET Jesse rides out from a stable leading a team of horses. He reaches the bank. JESSE No time to gawk, boys, we got somewhere else to be! Frank and Cole rush out from the bank. The Gang leaps onto the horses and put the spurs to them hard. ANGLE ON the Gang galloping past the shattered wagon barricade, heading for the edge of town. Pinkerton riflemen run out of the bank and from behind the other barricade. One SHARPSHOOTER with a rifle drops to one knee, lines up... HIS POV shows Jesse in his sights. He tightens on the trigger, and just as he pulls -- -- Jim Younger rides into the line of fire! With a CRACK the bullet hits Jim square in the back. He slumps forward on his horse. Comanche Tom leaps from his horse onto Jim's and urges it on. ANGLE ON The James Gang disappearing past the edge of town. The Pinkertons stand stunned amongst the ruin of their ambush. Alan Pinkerton himself walks up, shaking his head. EXT. HILL COUNTRY - EVENING The Gang rides up onto a wooded hill where huge rocks jut from the earth. They all dismount, Jesse and Cole supporting Jim's limp form as they pull him from the saddle. Jim is drenched in blood. JESSE Okay, you're gonna rest here. COLE Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty! CLELL That's a long ride, Cole. We won't be back 'til morning. JESSE Then you better get going! Cole and Jesse are united again in their grief over Jim. COLE Bob, rip up some bandages. JESSE Pass me some whisky. Jim's eyes flutter open for the first time. JIM ... too young for whisky... JESSE This time we'll make an exception. JIM Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time... JESSE You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her, Jimmy. COLE Jim, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. JIM Best time of my life. (weakly) I was famous, y'know... Jim dies. Cole cradles the body, begins rocking. Comanche Tom puts a hand on Bob's shoulder as Bob slumps against a rock. Jesse stands, walks away heavily. EXT. HILLTOP - A WHILE LATER Sunset is heavy in the sky. Jesse stares off at it. His anguish is palpable. Frank comes over. JESSE Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim. FRANK Jim was old enough... JESSE (snorts) He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that? FRANK Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him. JESSE You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know. FRANK Yeah. JESSE A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking? FRANK I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time. Jesse remembers the first time Frank said that. He crosses BACK TO the Gang. ANGLE ON the Gang -- what's left of them -- waiting by the horses. The unspoken knowledge of whose fault this is hangs in the air. Cole is covered in Jim's blood. COLE We'll make them pay for this. JESSE I'm out. COLE WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?! JESSE Who's next? You? Me? Bob? Cole can't answer. CLELL We can't exactly go back to our lives, Jesse. JESSE I'm not telling you what to do. You want to keep on following Cole, fine by me. BOB Frank? Frank nods. He's leaving too. COLE Go ahead. Ride on. But don't come back when you figure out you can't farm with a six-gun. Bob embraces Frank. Jesse goes to shake hands with Cole, but the guilt and rage make his once-best friend unapproachable. Jesse smiles sadly and walks away. EXT. MIMMS HOME - EARLY MORNING Zee is letting a dog out. She looks up, freezes. Entranced, she walks out onto the porch. ANGLE ON A figure appearing out of the early morning fog. It's Jesse, riding slow. He reins his horse in at the porch, dismounts. He stands staring at Zee. JESSE Zee. ZEE Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county! JESSE I had to see you. I'm getting married. Zee is shocked. Jesse looks serious. ZEE I don't understand. JESSE She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind. ZEE That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought... JESSE She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri. It takes Zee a second. Before she can process it all, Jesse drops to one knee. JESSE (CONT'D) I've quit my outlaw ways. Come live in my home and in my heart. Zee takes the hat off Jesse's head, tosses it into the yard and smiles. Jesse stands up and they kiss. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. HORSE DRAWN TAXI - DAY Victorian wooden houses with tin roofs and palm trees line the street. Jesse and Zee ride in the back of the open carriage. They can't take their eyes off each other. ZEE I would never have imagined us in a place like this. JESSE That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here. ZEE Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement? JESSE I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time. ZEE Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding. Jesse leans forward to the DRIVER. JESSE Driver, change of plans. Take us to the nearest church. DRIVER What religion? JESSE Whichever one has God in it, that'll do fine. INT. CHURCH RECTORY - DAY A PASTOR sits at his desk while Jesse finishes filling out a marriage license. PASTOR This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation. JESSE You don't think God'll mind, do you? Jesse slides him two twenties with the license. PASTOR The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable. (reading the license) ""Jesse Woodson James."" Jesse James? The Jesse James? JESSE I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your... PASTOR Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth. JESSE Thank you. PASTOR Who needs to repair a leaky church roof. Grinning, Jesse slides over another forty. PASTOR (CONT'D) Now let's have a drink. JESSE Right here in church? PASTOR Communion. The Pastor pours. They drink. EXT. CHURCH - DAY The BELLS RING as Jesse and Zee walk out the front door arm in arm. The Pastor and his wife appear in the doorway, waving. Jesse and Zee hop in a waiting carriage. DISSOLVE TO: INT. BANK - DAY Various townsfolk are lined up at the TELLER'S window. Cole, Bob, Comanche Tom, Clell and some NEW GANG MEMBERS BURST IN. COLE Nobody move! This is a robbery. Everybody's hands reach for the ceiling. Cole gestures to the Teller. COLE (CONT'D) The safe. Now. TELLER Of course! (pause) Uh, sir? COLE What? TELLER Where is Jesse James? COLE This here is the Younger Gang! A MAN speaks out timidly. MAN But the Youngers ride with Jesse James. COLE Did ride. No more. The crowd grumbles, plainly disappointed. COLE (CONT'D) OPEN THE DAMN SAFE! TELLER All right, all right. (muttering) Jesse James never yelled at folk... Bob and Comanche Tom exchange looks behind a fuming Cole. INT. SALOON - NIGHT The new Gang is spending its booty. Cole is putting a healthy dent in a bottle of rotgut. Bob is consoling him. BOB This is the best score yet. COLE It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to. BOB That was because of... the reputation the gang had. COLE As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve. BOB Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean. COLE Leave me alone, Bob. Even Bob can't reach Cole now. He walks sadly away. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. BEACH - DAY A deserted Keys beach -- coconut palms and Australian pines. Clear water like glass stretching off forever. Jesse and Zee are having a picnic on the white sand. Both are in the latest in beach attire. He's in a one-piece that goes from his neck to his knees. Zee's in what is basically a dress with long pantaloons. Zee is reading. Jesse is stretched out on the sand. ZEE Hmm. JESSE ""Hmm"" what? ZEE (reading) ""But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."" Jesse sits up. JESSE I beg your pardon? ZEE (showing him the cover) ""Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James."" Only a dime in the hotel lobby. JESSE Let me see that. ZEE Oh, I'm not finished. (reading) ""When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."" (looking at him) As I said. Hmm. JESSE Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you? ZEE Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy? JESSE Aw, shucks, ma'am... ZEE Stop it. This is just sad. JESSE Swimming. Swimming is good. Jesse jumps up and OUT OF FRAME. A second later, he reaches down and PULLS a chuckling Zee up out of the sand. EXT. OCEAN - DAY Jesse chases Zee out into the surf. They splash around until the water gets shoulder-deep, then both submerge. They reappear, locked in a kiss. CLOSE ON Zee's face as they break the kiss and embrace. She's in heaven. She opens her eyes, facing the beach. Something passes over her face. ANGLE ON the beach, where fifty Pinkerton detectives with rifles are lined up like a firing squad. BACK TO Zee's face. She squeezes Jesse tighter. ZEE Don't turn around. JESSE What? ZEE If you don't see it, it's not real... Jesse turns around to see -- EXT. BEACH A familiar figure walking along the sand. When the figure reaches the center of the line of detectives, he turns to the couple and -- PINKERTON Jesse James, you are under arrest! Jesse takes one longing gaze at the open ocean. He heads for shore. DISSOLVE TO: INT. SALOON Cole and the Gang are killing time. Bob runs in. BOB They arrested Jesse! He throws the paper to the other Gang members, but walks straight to Cole. The two brothers stare at each other. COLE How'd they -- BOB What have you done? COLE I ain't done -- BOB WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?! Bob draws on Cole. Cole is shattered. COLE Bob. I didn't... BOB Swear. COLE I swear -- BOB Swear on Jimmy's grave. Cole hesitates. Bob thumbs back the hammer. Comanche Tom's hand closes over Bob's gun. COMANCHE TOM Bob. You know Cole would never do such a thing. He and Jesse are best friends. They are cousins, blood brothers. Bob considers it, lowers the gun. BOB I'm sorry, Cole. COLE You're just upset about Jesse. We all are. Bob walks off. Comanche Tom speaks, but keeps his eyes on Bob. COMANCHE TOM My people know that when a brother kills a brother, a great curse comes down on that man, and when he dies he walks the desert as a dark spirit. I like Bob too much to let that happen. (looking at Cole) If I find out you turned in Jesse, I'll kill you myself. Comanche Tom moves off. Cole's thoughts are his own. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. FORT JEFFERSON - NIGHT An establishing shot of the Florida fort being lashed by rain. INT. CELL A dank, black cell far in the bowels of Fort Jefferson. WE HEAR CLANKING. WIDEN TO REVEAL Jesse doing push-ups. They come easily, despite Jesse being chained up like the Frankenstein monster. The DOOR OPENS. Jesse looks up in mid-push-up. Alan Pinkerton is looking down at him. Jesse moves to the bed. Pinkerton, flanked by two guards, ENTERS. He sits on a stool provided by one of the guards. PINKERTON We're moving you tomorrow. JESSE But I like the presidential suite. PINKERTON Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers. JESSE So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains? PINKERTON That's the idea. Pinkerton produces two cigars, presenting one to Jesse. JESSE Did you order our houses burned down? PINKERTON Not that day. I am guilty of many things, but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker, that day. Jesse takes the cigar, and Pinkerton lights both. They puff for a moment. PINKERTON (CONT'D) (tapping bad leg) Was this you, by the way? Jesse exposes his scar. JESSE You almost ended my career before it began. PINKERTON Pity. Pause. PINKERTON (CONT'D) How did you spot the ambush in Torrell? JESSE Last February? PINKERTON Mmm. JESSE You had all those cattle there, so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive? PINKERTON Yes? JESSE The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town. PINKERTON Damn. Pause. JESSE Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me. PINKERTON I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much. JESSE No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one. PINKERTON Oh. That's nice to know. (then) We're going to hang you, you know. JESSE I figured. PINKERTON Was it worth it? JESSE Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it. PINKERTON That's what I would have done. JESSE I'm not hanged yet. PINKERTON (shaking his head) You cocky little bastard. JESSE Ahh, you'll miss me. PINKERTON No, I'll hang you. (then) But I may miss you just a bit. As Jesse and Pinkerton smoke and discuss the past year... EXT. TRAINYARD Two guards are leading Jesse, who is in heavy arm irons, toward a prison car at the end of a waiting train. Pinkerton, Thaddeus Rains, and Parker walk up. RAINS This is him. PARKER I remember you. JESSE You're Parker. I remember you, too. You killed my Ma. Parker is set back by Jesse's voice. To cover his fear -- PARKER How did you know? RAINS Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton? PINKERTON If you feel that way, I could always take off the irons. Rains glares at Pinkerton, then turns back to Jesse. RAINS You stole thousands. You cost me tens of millions of dollars, months of lost construction. I wish I could hang you every single morning for a century. Rains checks his Pocketwatch, spots Jesse eyeing it. RAINS (CONT'D) You like that? Solid gold, my father had it made when he started this railroad. He gave it to me when I took over, I'll give it to my son when he runs this company, and he'll give it to his son -- The right type of men will always run this country, Jesse James, and little men like you will always suffer. You have stopped nothing. JESSE Made you think twice about burning folks' homes down now, didn't I? Jesse winks. With that Parker reaches back and SUCKER PUNCHES Jesse. Rains gloats as Jesse gets his breath back. RAINS We'll speak again in Washington, you insect. JESSE You're coming on the same train? Rains involuntarily looks behind Jesse. Jesse cranes his head and spots a CLUB CAR at the front of the train, several cars away from his prison car. The other cars are packed with Pinkerton detectives. JESSE (CONT'D) Well, tell you what. I'm going to have to pay you a visit. RAINS Big words. JESSE It's a promise. Everyone is a little shaken by the steel in Jesse's voice. The guards DRAG JESSE OFF. INT. PRISON CAR The guards turn Jesse over to a BURLY DETECTIVE. Pinkerton enters just behind him. There are ten detectives in total in the car. PINKERTON Hook him up. The Burly Detective brings Jesse's arms above his head. He loops Jesse's chain over a rail that runs the length of the car. Two other detectives walk Jesse down the car, Jesse's hands suspended over his head. Jesse can just barely sit down. PINKERTON (CONT'D) Now the guns. BURLY DETECTIVE I don't like it. We can handle him. PINKERTON In the ten seconds we have been in this car, I have seen you get close enough for Jesse James to grab your guns at least three times. And I assure you, if he gets his hands on one of your guns, you are all, and I mean all dead men. BURLY DETECTIVE He's chained up. PINKERTON I'll put that on your tombstone. The guns. Grumbling, the detectives deposit their pistols in a box near the front of the car. Pinkerton walks out. The Burly Detective slides a Colt into his waistband. ANGLE ON Jesse, alone, surrounded by ten Pinkerton guards. The train LURCHES, and they're off. EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The prison train highballs through the wooded, rolling hills. We see the engine, the coal car, a detective car, then the private salon car, two more cars of guards, and then the prison car. INT. PRISON CAR Five guards are playing poker. Five others are standing along the length of the car. Jesse looks at the gun box waaay down the other end of the car. Things shift, and we (and Jesse) realize the train is going downhill. JESSE Hey, fatty. The Burly Detective looks up. BURLY DETECTIVE What? JESSE You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy! The detectives close on Jesse. Jesse stands as the Burly Detective moves right up on him. BURLY DETECTIVE What you sayin' boy? JESSE I think I recognize you. BURLY DETECTIVE How? JESSE I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back. The other detectives try to hide grins. BURLY DETECTIVE You shut up now, boy. JESSE No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your -- Burly Detectives BACKHANDS Jesse. Jesse spits blood and grins. JESSE (CONT'D) Yeah, she said you did that to her too. Burly draws, points the gun right at Jesse's face. The other detectives GASP. Jesse stares down the barrel, then raises his eyes and speaks in a voice that is low and terrifying. JESSE (CONT'D) Y'know, I could do this without the gun, but it just makes things easier. SLAM as Jesse KICKS Burly in the crotch! The gun FIRES, missing Jesse's head only because he jerks it like a mongoose. Jesse BACKHANDS the detective with the heavy chain! The gun drops right into Jesse's hands -- The guards are running for the gun box -- Jesse flips the chain TIGHT, TUCKS UP and KICKS OFF from the back wall and SLIDES THE LENGTH OF THE RAIL over the detectives' heads! As he reaches the end he FIRES the gun, blowing open the gun box. Jesse then SHOOTS the rail's ceiling strut, and then KICKS at the roof. The rail WRENCHES FREE, dropping Jesse to the floor. In a blur he's up, reaching into the gun box. He tosses one gun INTO THE AIR, then FANS THE HAMMER of another. Half the guards drop, but the other half are right on top of him and nobody's that fast -- Jesse drops the spent gun, CATCHES the other gun in the opposite hand and FANS THAT HAMMER all in a single breath! As the smoke clears, the last of the detectives falls with a THUD. EXT. TRAIN Jesse pops open the door to his car. He's improvised a gunbelt like his old one, holding six Colts. He's still holding the chain from his restraints. Now that they're no longer wrapped around Jesse, we see they're at least a few yards long. INT. THIRD TROOP CAR Some Pinkertons LOOK UP as a BANG sounds from on top of the car. EXT. TRAIN And Jesse JUMPS OFF THE ROOF and -- CLANK as the chains -- fastened to the roof -- go taut and Jesse is at window level and he's FIRING AND FIRING into the car! INT. THIRD TROOP CAR Pinkertons falling, drawing their guns, not able to get a bead on Jesse because -- EXT. TRAIN Jesse is running along the side of the car, supported by the chain! Still shooting, he reaches the end, KICKS UP and is on the roof again. ANGLE ON one Detective, barely alive, stumbling through the door, opening the door to the next INT. SECOND TROOP CAR The detectives inside start as the wounded man falls into the doorway. EXT. TRAIN Jesse looks down and sees heavily armed Pinkertons coming out of the doorway. JESSE Shit. But there's no turning back and he jumps to the top of the EXT. SECOND TROOP CAR Jesse's running and the Pinkertons start SHOOTING THROUGH the roof. Jesse miraculously is untouched, almost to the CLUB CAR... INT. CLUB CAR Pinkerton is already moving as Parker and Thaddeus Rains look around. RAINS What the hell is that sound? PINKERTON Vengeance. INT. FIRST TROOP CAR Pinkerton bursts in. The men snap to. PINKERTON Outside! Get up on top! Go GO! EXT. CLUB CAR Jesse JUMPS onto the club car, but pulls up short as detectives appear ahead of him. He turns to see other detectives climbing up behind him. He's trapped. BUT WE HEAR A LOW WHISTLE AND EXT. TRAIN ENGINE The engine EXPLODES! Sparks fly as the twisted engine GRINDS onto the tracks! EXT. TRAIN The momentum carries everyone off their feet! Some detectives are torn from the train. Jesse slides across the roof of the Club Car -- CUT TO: EXT. TRAIN TRACK CLOSE ON a smoking CANNON sitting on the tracks. WIDEN TO REVEAL Frank and Cole on horseback shading their eyes. Zee is daintily blowing out a fuse lighter. FRANK Nice shot. ZEE Thank you. Now go get my husband. The two men start to gallop toward the train. EXT. TRAIN Jesse, Pinkerton, and the detectives look down the track and see... EXT. TRAIN TRACK Frank and Cole riding toward them. From the woods ride Comanche Tom and Bob Younger, folding into perfect formation. The four THUNDER toward the train. INT. CLUB CAR Pinkerton rushes back in. Parker and Rains are looking out the window. PARKER There's only four of them... PINKERTON Move you fools! He grabs the two businessmen and heads them to the rear of the train. EXT. TRAIN TRACK Frank draws a gun and FIRES. EXT. WOODS TWO DOZEN RIDERS pour out of the woods, all firing at the Pinkerton! The Pinkertons return fire, taking shelter in the train cars as the riders strafe the train. EXT. TRAIN Jesse swings over the edge of the train, looks through the window. Rains is gone. He turns and starts running back along the top of the train. EXT. PRISON CAR Pinkerton, Rains and Parker tumble out of the door and run for the woods. Jesse LEAPS DOWN from the top of the train onto Pinkerton! They wrestle, separate. Pinkerton stands, reaching for his gunbelt. Empty. With almost a resigned sigh, he looks up. Jesse's pointing the gun at Pinkerton's head. PINKERTON Do it. Jesse FIRES. ANGLE ON Pinkerton, stunned to realize he's still alive. He turns to see Parker, fall to the ground, his own gun half-drawn, Jesse turns the gun on Rains. JESSE That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else. PINKERTON He's too important, James. They'll set the army on you. You and your wife. Jesse stares at Rains, Rains stares back, the tension building...Jesse's about to shoot...and says: JESSE That is a nice watch you got there. Rains looks down at the fob, back up. The tension isn't broken. JESSE (CONT'D) I tell you what, I'll buy that watch from you, for the fair market price approved by the Department of the Interior: one dollar. Rains hesitates. Jesse thumbs the hammer back JESSE (CONT'D) If I were you, I'd sell. After this, the price goes...down. Rains tosses the Watch to Jesse as Jesse simultaneously FLIPS Rains a dollar coin with his free hand. Jesse holds up the Watch. JESSE (CONT'D) Now every time you go to look at this watch and it's not there, you'll remember: You can be stopped. Pass that down to your son, instead. Jesse thumbs the hammer forwards, lowers the gun. Rains falls to his knees, numb from the tension. Frank rides up. Jesse empties Pinkerton's gun and hands it to him. Pinkerton holds him for a second. PINKERTON (low) Tennessee. Jesse doesn't understand. PINKERTON (CONT'D) The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee. JESSE Thanks. PINKERTON I'd just as soon kill you, Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time. JESSE Fair enough. Zee RIDES UP. Jesse SWINGS UP onto her horse, and then they RIDE OFF with Frank. We PULL UP AND AWAY, centering on Pinkerton, Rains, and revealing the smoking, burning wreckage of the train. EXT. HILLSIDE FIELDS - DAY Most of the Gang is mounted. Frank, Cole and Bob are standing there, watching. ANGLE ON Jesse and Zee riding up on one horse. ZEE You get arrested again, I'll kill you. JESSE Yes ma'am. ZEE I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you. JESSE You are a hell of a woman. ZEE Don't swear. JESSE Yes ma'am. They reach the Gang. Jesse SWINGS OFF his horse, gets one of Cole's BEAR HUGS. COLE Missed you, cousin. JESSE Missed you too, cousin. Jesse notices Cole is oddly emotional, but can't quite figure out what's going on. COLE You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought -- JESSE Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind. The two clasp hands. BOB Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says ""Let's ride."" COLE He's not bad at it. BOB It's tougher than it looks. JESSE Where'd you get all these riders? COLE We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw. BOB So what's the plan? Jesse looks at Zerelda and Frank. JESSE I think my wife and I might go down Tennessee way, buy a farm. (pause) Goodbye, boys. The Youngers smile sadly, but NOD. As the Younger brothers SADDLE UP, Comanche Tom leans down from the saddle and shakes Jesse's hand. COMANCHE TOM You stay out of trouble, Jesse. Nobody has as much luck as you used up today. ANGLE ON Jesse getting back on his horse with Zee. Frank stands there and watches them. FRANK I'll meet you down there in a few weeks. JESSE See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there. FRANK Hell, they hardly even noticed us. Jesse and Frank grin. BOB Let's ride! Jesse flips the reins and he and Zee RIDE OFF, the GANG with the Youngers RIDES OFF in the opposite direction. Frank watches them ride away. WE HEAR faintly: ZEE Tennessee? JESSE I'll explain on the way. Then it's Frank alone on the hill. WE CIRCLE around behind him, come around, see he's AGED a little, CIRCLE AGAIN and now he's AGED MORE, we come around one more time and... EXT. HILLSIDE NEAR LIBERTY - DAY - TWENTY YEARS LATER ...we COMPLETE THE CIRCLE and see young Frank James is now an older FRANK JAMES. Still lean, a few wrinkles, a little grey in the hair, dressed in expensive turn-of-the-century western clothes. A young man who looks remarkably like Jesse, JIMMY JAMES, 16 years old, is waiting patiently. The two are looking down on the town of Liberty, Missouri, which is now swollen five sizes larger. The Wild West is disappearing under roads and telegraph wire. JIMMY Y'know, Uncle Frank... FRANK Yeah, Jimmy? JIMMY (genially chiding) ...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot. FRANK I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy. They start to walk back to the edge of town. FRANK (CONT'D) Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up. JIMMY Sounds like he was a hell of a man. FRANK (chuckling) That he was. JIMMY They're making him a hero now. FRANK Saved a lot of folk from the railroad. JIMMY But he killed a lot of men, too. FRANK Can't argue that. JIMMY So what was he? FRANK I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around. Frank chuckles again at the memories, claps his hand on Jimmy's shoulder. FRANK (CONT'D) Come on, your Ma's probably holding dinner for us. Once saw the woman blow up a train, don't want to tick her off... Jimmy grins and the pair walk down the hill. We stay ON THEIR BACKS as they continue talking. JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.) Uncle Frank? FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.) Yeah Jimmy? JIMMY (O.S.) (O.S.) How much of that story is true? FRANK (O.S.) (O.S.) Everything but the boring parts. FADE OUT: END OVER CREDITS: SEPIA TONED PHOTOGRAPHS of JESSE and ZEE enjoying their years as farmers, with VISITORS like FRANK, and the YOUNGERS also included."

by
Mard Andrus
And
James L. Brooks
Story by
Mark Andrus
FADE IN:
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT
ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an
enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up
against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the
unseen love of her long life.
SWEET-FACED WOMAN
I'm just going to get some
flowers, dear. I'll be back in
twenty minutes. It's tulip season
today. I'm so happy.
And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness
dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that
quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her
apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.
POV - MELVIN UDALL
in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved,
unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever
met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength
is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the
elevator door he holds open.
MELVIN
Come here, sweetheart... come on.
ON DOG
Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting.
Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the
mutt who has ignores him.
MELVIN
Wanna go for a ride? Okay,
sweetie?
The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges
and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog
urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG
sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.
MELVIN
(a malevolent tone)
You've pissed your last floor, you
dog-eared monkey.
The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much
meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout
shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the
garbage chute.
MELVIN
I'll bet you wish you were some
sort of real dog now, huh? Don't
worry... this is New York. If you
can make it here, you can make it
anywhere, you know? You ugly,
smelly fuck.
And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and
lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING ""ANOOOOS""
from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment
door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON
NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with
Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of
trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT
Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about
to enter his apartment.
SIMON
Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie...
He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.
SIMON
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey
there!
(as Melvin turns)
Have you seen Verdell?
MELVIN
What's he look like?
Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is
directly opposite Simon's.
SIMON
My dog... you know... I mean my
little dog with the adorable
face... Don't you know what my dog
looks like?
MELVIN
I got it. You're talking about
your dog. I thought that was the
name of the colored man I've been
seeing in the hall.
Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.
SIMON
Which color was that?
MELVIN
Like thick molasses, with one of
those wide noses perfect for
smelling trouble and prison
food...
Simon has had it.
SIMON
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
MELVIN
(not missing a beat)
How're you doing?
SIMON
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I
think you know that.
FRANK
(overlapping)
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
MELVIN
(to Simon)
What I know is that as long as you
keep your work zipped up around
me, I don't give a fuck what or
where you shove your show. Are we
being neighbors for now?
SIMON
(to Frank)
Do you still think I was
exaggerating?
FRANK can only smile.
FRANK
Definitely a package you don't
want to open or touch.
MELVIN
Hope you find him. I love that
dog.
Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds
himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.
SIMON
(directly)
You don't love anything, Mr.
Udall.
Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the
hallway.
MELVIN
I love throwing your dog down the
garbage chute.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to
five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and
off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards
his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens
the medicine chest.
INT. MEDICINE CHEST
Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps
one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the
process two more times.
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT
A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN
holding Verdell who looks and finds:
SIMON
who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves
quickly toward the group and his dog.
SIMON
Thank the good Lord... wow... my
honey... where have you been?
PARTY GOER
(thinking the greeting's
for him)
He always liked me.
As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the
Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a
laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As
the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside.
Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks
some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts
Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS
in protest.
SIMON
Just for a second, okay?
The DOG YAPS ""no."" Simon, delighted, picks him up again.
SIMON
(kissing him on the mouth)
Look at him... where was little
baby?
HANDYMAN
(smiling)
In the basement garbage bin eating
diaper shit.
Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in
cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.
SIMON
Go ahead, John, you earned your fun.
(looking at Verdell)
How did he get down in the
basement? I mean even if he got
on the elevator how... ?
HANDYMAN
Maybe some nice neighbor shoved
him down the garbage chute.
SIMON
My God! No!
He stares out... Frank frustrated following.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT
Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he
writes.
MELVIN
'Somewhat in the dark, she had
confessed and he had forgiven.
This is what you live for, he
said. Two heads on a pillow where
there is only the safety of being
with each other. How, she
wondered, could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her.'
He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.
SIMON (O.S.)
Mr. Udall.
But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.
MELVIN
'At last she was able to define
love. Love was... '
More KNOCKING.
SIMON (O.S.)
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you
please.
MELVIN
'Love was... '
He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of
love -- but the knocking throws him.
MELVIN
... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
stool-pusher.
He burst from his chair.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT
As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step
back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.
MELVIN
(loud and angry)
Yeeeess!!!
SIMON
Maybe this can wait.
Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.
SIMON
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
MELVIN
Well, that's a load off.
Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to
close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.
SIMON
Did you... do something to him?
MELVIN
Do you realize that I work at
him?
SIMON
(eyes downcast)
No, I didn't.
MELVIN
Do you like to be interrupt when
you are danging around in your
little garden?
SIMON
No... actually, I even shut the
phone off and put a little piece
of cardboard in the ringer so no
one can just buzz me from d...
MELVIN
Well, I work all the time. So
never, never again interrupt me.
Okay? I mean, never. Not 30
years from now... not if there's
fire. Not even if you hear a thud
from inside my home and a week
later there's a smell from in
there that can only come from a
decaying body and you have to hold
a hanky against your face because
the stench is so thick you think
you're going to faint even then
don't come knocking or, if it's
election night and you're excited
and want to celebrate because some
fudge-packer you dated has been
elected the first queer President
of the United States... and he's
going to put you up in Camp David
and you just want to share the
moment with someone... don't knock
... not on this door. Not for
anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
SIMON
Yes. It's not a subtle point
you're making.
MELVIN
Okay, then.
Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.
SIMON
So the theory of confrontations is
that now he'll think twice before
messing with me?
Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.
SIMON
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't
he?
FRANK
Won't worry about it. You go
ahead.
Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly
on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.
MELVIN (O.S.)
Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really
pissed!!!
Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open.
Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him
forward... Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.
MELVIN
No touch. No touch. No touch.
FRANK
You may think you can intimidate
the whole world with your
attitude, but I grew up in Hell.
My grandmother had more attitude.
You don't intimidate me.
MELVIN
(calling)
Police! Police! Fucking crooked
police... doughnut-munching morons
help me!
(to Frank)
Assault and battery and you're
black.
FRANK
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like
him enough to batter you
unrecognizable if you verbally
abuse him or so much as touch his
dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try
and think how you can make this up
to him.
(suddenly loud)
I hate doing this. I'm an art
dealer.
(beat)
Have a nice day. Party!
He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens
his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as
he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears
impressed.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY
A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His
walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the
danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear.
At times he places his palms together and extends his
arms cutting a path through people. We will be very
pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.
CLOSER ON MELVIN
His eyes focused on the terrain.
INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY
ANGLE ON WAITRESS
CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer.
You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be
the most carefree time of the day. She is telling a
story about her son for the umpteenth time.
CAROL
(to the Mother's
little girl)
Look at you, you're all better.
MOTHER
It's that new medication.
CAROL
You know all my son's stuff,
right?
The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but
Carol interrupts her.
CAROL
No, no, no, I got a date tonight.
I'm walking out the door this
morning and he says to me, 'Mom,
I promise not to get one of my
fevers or coughs during your
date.'
MOTHER
Isn't that sweet.
CAROL
Little blonde angle.
(to child,
affectionately)
Eat everything.
Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a
table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find
a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.
WOMAN
It just came out of me. I said
you love me the way a remote
control loves a TV. As long as I
switch every time...
HER MALE COMPANION
Wonderful.
MELVIN
People who talk in metaphors can
shampoo my crotch.
(on their look)
Eat up.
They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the
waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL,
are talking.
LISA
Pay me back next week.
CAROL
I owe you. I told you today...
them's the rules. Oh, excuse me,
Melvin.
She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out
of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else
ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.
MELVIN
I'm starving.
CAROL
(firmly to Lisa)
Will you please take it?
Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with
stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out
of the way...
LISA
This way you take a cab home so
you have time to get ready for the
date.
CAROL
""Ready"" is not my problem.
She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could
read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the
date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.
CAROL
(to Melvin)
Go sit down. You know you're not
allowed back here... Spencer's
more excited about it than I am...
He says, ""Mom, I promise not to
get a fever or couch during your date.""
The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go
""awww.""
CAROL
I know. He's just the best.
MELVIN
I've got Jews at my table.
CAROL
It's not your table. It's the
place's table. Behave. This
once, you can sit at someone
else's station.
The two waitresses signal their protests.
CAROL
Or you can just wait your turn...
Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper... he hangs
near their table... his discomfort builds in this limbo...
then:
MELVIN
How much more you got to eat?
Your appetite isn't as big as
your noses, is it?
WOMAN
What?!!
MAN
(to Woman)
Let's go --
The Woman starts to protest.
MAN
Let's leave. We're going.
Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his
pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed.
As he opens his utensils.
CAROL
Bryan says he doesn't care how
long you've been coming you ever
act like this again you're barred
for life. I'm gonna miss the
excitement, but I'll handle it.
There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some
ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only
one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear
the table.
MELVIN
The table's fine if it had some
cholesterol on it. Two sausages,
six bacon strips, fries, three
eggs over easy and coffee.
CAROL
You're gonna die soon with that
diet, you know that?
MELVIN
We're all gonna die soon. I will.
You will. It sure sounds like
your son will.
ON CAROL
Stunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her
perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin
senses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.
CAROL
If you ever mention my son again,
you will never be able to eat here
again. Do you understand? Give me
some sign you understand or leave
now. Do you understand me...
(adds truthful label)
you crazy freak? Do you?!?
A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing
down.
CAROL
Okay. I'll get your order.
She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower
lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room
sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make
noises as she responds... each time startling herself
with her own noise and trying to reign it in.
She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway
-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the
emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young
Man stops and looks at her.
YOUNG MAN
What?
CAROL
I... I... I don't know... You got
me.
His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited
but doesn't know how to play it... He pushes one of the
fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her
mouth... She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt
opening her mouth. She stops him.
CAROL
Let me just do whatever I do by
myself... I'll catch up to you
someplace I promise.
(as he's put off)
Oh, no... don't look like that.
No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.
And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed
the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about
egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when
we hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and
COUGHING.
CAROL
Kissing... kissing boys. Oh my.
Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.
SPENCER (O.S.)
(softly)
Grandma, grandma...
YOUNG MAN
Maybe you better check.
CAROL
Like what did you think I was
going to do?
INT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT
Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway...
she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her
mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones...
she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the
cough.
BEVERLY
I'm sorry. I was hearing just
everything you were doing so I put
these on to give you privacy.
Carol now goes into her son's room.
INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT
The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights...
two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer
(breathing contraption) a waste basket... a night stand
filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit... along with
some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged
into the tiny space.
SPENCER
I'm sorry.
CAROL
Don't be silly. How bad?
SPENCER
Not bad.
Carol feels his head... that's okay. Then he coughs --
trying to suppress it... then a bigger cough... they each
know what that signals... She brings up a waste basket as
he throws up... she comforts him. He apologizes. She
loves him.
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.
CAROL
(a bit panicked)
You can't smoke... He can't take
smoke.
He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand
squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his
hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he
picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking
at her with extreme distaste... She barks a laugh to
cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth.
CAROL
Oh, God... I don't even notice
anymore.
She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make
light.
CAROL
That'll teach you.
YOUNG MAN
Don't apologize.
CAROL
(perturbed)
That wasn't an apology.
She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her --
how uncomfortable he is.
CAROL
Hey... this is just a little throw-
up -- it's nothing to be so
embarrassed about. Really.
(as he shifts
uncomfortably)
Thanks for the dinner. Let me
write down which trains you take
to get back.
YOUNG MAN
No way.
She brightens.
YOUNG MAN
I'll take a cab.
She deflates as he moves past her.
YOUNG MAN
Too much reality for a Friday
night.
EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT
A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the
approach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN
and DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and
the most likeable of the gritty little trio.
EVAN
Why is every customer surprised I
read books?
DOUG
(amazed)
You read books?
EVAN
Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look!
He even bought me dinner.
They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in
front of them. CARL checks them out carefully through
the front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.
CARL
(slightly exasperated)
Look, I just can't. I promised
Simon I'd find him a model.
FRIEND (V.O.)
(on speaker phone,
flirting)
Carl, take me off the speaker.
Did I tell you that these are
house seats? C'mon, you could use
a break. Hello... Carl, are you
there... hello?
Seeing the hustlers:
CARL
.... I just found a model.
DOUG
(to Carl)
Hey, how it's goin'...
EVAN
Hey, hi... remember?
CARL
I only need one.
EVAN
You picked me up, maybe a few
weeks, I don't know, some time
ago. You were very flattering
about our... encounter.
CARL
Maybe just you and me... but this
is for a painting. I need a
pretty face.
Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal
his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY
There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer.
He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace
humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who
scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.
SIMON
Sorry, I was out in the studio
doing some work and I forgot about
our appointment.
He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away
-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him
and eyeing the expensive apartment.
SIMON
I usually make such a big deal out
of picking models but Carl's so
thorough. I'll bet he drove you
nuts checking your references.
And he turns and sees the naked model.
SIMON
(taken aback)
This isn't a nude.
Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.
VINCENT
Just kidding around.
(then mutters)
So much for love.
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)
Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the
increasingly uneasy Simon.
SIMON
Exactly what is your previous
experience?
VINCENT
How about that pose?
(sing-song)
This is not fun...
(then)
Give me some direction.
Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He
tries not to show it.
SIMON
Nothing. I just watch till
something strikes me. Do anything
you think of -- try different
thing. Until I say, ""hold that
pose."" Then just try and
comfortably hold it.
VINCENT
(trying another space)
The fact that you haven't said,
""hold it"" means I haven't done it
right... is that correct? I
haven't done it right?
SIMON
No... Okay. What I do is watch
and wait for, um... You ever watch
someone who doesn't know you're
watching... an old woman on a bus,
kids going to school and you see
this flash come over them and you
know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything
external -- that it's in respond
to a private thought they just
had? They are just sort of realer
and more alive. And when you
notice it so are you. If you look
at someone long enough, you
discover their humanity.
Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an
intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.
VINCENT
I know exactly what you mean.
There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.
SIMON
Hold it.
Vincent does so -- hums a bit of ""Satisfaction"" to
celebrate.
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their
order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story
of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life.
Carol is rapt.
As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give
him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so
-- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment
commentary on her every action.
MELVIN
Clippity clop -- clippity clop --
she has to pretend she doesn't
hear me. Listening to the story
from the upset friend... now she
drops off the cappuccino and
smiles at the putzette who doesn't
even say, ""Thank you."" No, the
putzette wanted the whipped cream
so back she goes and now she has
to pass him again and it's getting
tougher to make believe.
CAROL
(reluctant forgiveness)
Okay.
Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an
uncharacteristic rabbit punch.
CAROL
What's with the plastic picnic
ware? Why not try ours... afraid
it isn't clean?
MELVIN
I see the help -- judgement call.
CAROL
Just give yourself a little pep
talk. ""Must try other people's
clean silverware as part of the
fun of dining out.""
MELVIN
What's wrong with your son,
anyway?
CAROL
What do you care?
Melvin just looks at her.
CAROL
He's gotta fight to breathe.
His asthma can just shoot off the
charts -- he's allergic to dust
and this is New York and his
immune system bails on him when
there's trouble so an ear
infection... Is this bothering
you?
MELVIN
(caught)
No.
CAROL
An ear infection can send us to
the emergency room -- maybe five,
six times a month where I get
whatever nine-year-old they just
made a doctor. Nice chatting with
you.
MELVIN
His name?
CAROL
Spencer.
MELVIN
Okay.
CAROL
(quietly)
Spence.
She exits.
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)
The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts
the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat
and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and
the scene -- gone before we can examine him further.
SIMON
You can put on anything you want
now. I might be sort of done
here...
Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his
immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every
second of silence during the transition... then LOUD
MUSIC PLAYS... Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME. Simon
does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down --
which Vincent does.
ANGLE - APARTMENT
where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress --
Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all
objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses
to look past the terrace to the studio.
DOUG
Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, STUDIO - DAY
MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.
VINCENT
So you're practically finished,
huh?
SIMON
Yes... well, there's one more
stage -- trying to figure out if
it's any good.
Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another
perspective... he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod
of self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate
to distract.
CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his
ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to
frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.
As Simon keeps walking... Vincent shoots over to the
canvas.
VINCENT
Wait -- I want to see the
painting.
SIMON
Just a second -- he has to go.
VINCENT
Please!! NO!!!
Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a
bullet. Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown
to see his humanity captured -- to be ""immortalized.""
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL
stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK.
Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he
continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing
them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.
SIMON
(to Vincent)
What's the matter, sweetheart?
He instantly stops. Shocked. Frozen. His eyes on the
stranger, Doug, looking at him. Now Vincent comes in.
Doug greets him.
DOUG
Yo.
Simon turns to Vincent.
SIMON
Why are you doing this?
VINCENT
No. No. No. Hey, that painting
in there... I just want to tell
you...
Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack.
EVAN
(to Vincent)
What are you doing? Cruising him?
And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a
club, as the brief savage attack begins.
ON VERDELL
as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in
fear. The three attackers leave. Now silence. A single
BARK from VERDELL.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK
A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is
whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if
Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the
wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.
RAY
Okay. So you call 911 and don't
leave your name -- even a dumb
geezer should know that emergency
automatically pulls up your name.
How come you make a mistake like
that?
MELVIN
How come you're pretending to do
cop work -- 'cause I don't think
you could find your ass if you
were spotted the hole.
RAY
(stunned)
What?
MELVIN
Just move on. No one here killed
him.
RAY
Oh, is he dead?
MELVIN
Ask him.
RAY
We will if we can and if we can't,
we'll come back and ask you again
and again.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY -
ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a
leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic
little CRYING SOUNDS.
As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell... Frank is talking to the
Sweet-Faced Woman.
SWEET-FACED WOMAN
I've been praying for him since I
heard.
FRANK
So I've got to get to the
hospital. If you could take the
dog just for tonight.
SWEET-FACED WOMAN
Oh, Lord -- I've got all these
antique knick-knacks... Or else
I'd be glad...
FRANK
Maybe if you kept locked in
the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.
(as he turns away and she
closes the door he adds)
Old bitch... Damn dog.
A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed
and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings...
VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches
his mugger:
FRANK
You're taking him... yes... you're
taking him -- this will clear the
books. One night. You want to
say ""no"" to me? Try... because
I've never felt as nuts as I do
right this second. I almost want
you to try saying ""no.""
MELVIN
(quietly)
I'm not saying nothing to you.
FRANK
Thanks for looking after him.
Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and
places Verdell inside.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to
block Verdell's escape.
The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped
in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We
STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head
turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue
continues O.S.
MELVIN (O.S.)
Hey, where are you going? You
can't do this.
(calls after Frank)
I can't take a dog.
(a confession)
Nobody's ever been in here before.
FRANK (O.S.)
(threatening)
You don't want to mess with me
today. I'll figure something else
out tomorrow.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now
Melvin sees him.
MELVIN
You're dead!!
VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking
along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a
bit calming.
MELVIN
I don't have dog food. And I
won't want dog food here. You'll
eat what we have. You'll eat what
we eat.
Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped
meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the
room.
MELVIN
Don't you touch anything.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC
CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and
exits... Verdell breathes excitedly though looking
alternately in all directions... his recent past making
him suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs
cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a
dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S. we hear the sound
of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then
MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns... ignoring Verdell he
sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd.
Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl
with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and
sing Monty Python's ""Always Look On The Bright Side Of
Life,"" with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks
over with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts
and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out
the lights and exits.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
Frank on the phone.
FRANK
(into phone)
Put the solid red dots on three of
them and the hold blue dots on two
others... Well, we're not going to
sell anything if they know we're
two weeks into a show and have no
sales. No, you can't reduce a
price at this stage... We're in
free fall here. Any calls?
JACKIE
We can see him.
FRANK
I'll meet you in there.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
As Jackie enters.
JACKIE
How you doing, great one?
SIMON
I haven't looked at myself yet. I
figured I could tell from your
reaction.
He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his
painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a
horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into
yuccchhh... The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into
tears... sobs, actually.
SIMON
That bad, huh?
They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in
the doorway.
FRANK
Hey, hey...
(as he sees him)
Haaa... bad but temporary. The
nurses say it's much better than
you looked three weeks ago... the
hand will come back... they're
sure...
SIMON
Jackie, will you hand me the
mirror?
JACKIE
(a small voice)
No.
She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse --
then thinks better of it.
JACKIE
Wait, I have a smaller one.
But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror --
he starts to look -- then thinks better of it.
SIMON
So, what's new anyway? How's
Verdell?
FRANK
(sheepish)
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is
taking care of him.
SIMON
(suddenly alive and upset)
How could you do that? He'll hurt
him.
FRANK
No, I promise... not a chance. I
own this guy. There was no one
else. I'm on the move too much.
Trust me.
SIMON
You are very certain my dog is
okay... because you have no
idea...
FRANK
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery,
then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive
underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.
SIMON
Okay, waiting gives the devil
time. Now!
He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror...
he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him
awed by his misfortune.
SIMON
Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?
EXT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY
AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.
INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY
Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with
his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as
she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning
periodically to keep an eye of his dog.
CAROL
So what are you doing with a dog?
MELVIN
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed
around.
CAROL
You're not worried that someone
might take him?
MELVIN
Well, not until now -- for
Christ's sake.
CAROL
Sorry.
MELVIN
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can
keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.
CAROL
You know he's a little dog. Next
time, if Bryan's not here, you can
bring him in.
MELVIN
How old are you?
CAROL
Oh, please...
MELVIN
If I had to guess by your eyes,
I'd say you were fifty.
Carol looks at him.
CAROL
And if I had to guess by your
eyes. I'd say you were kind. So,
so much for eyes. But as long as
you bring up age... how old are
you?
MELVIN
(quickly)
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
CAROL
(laughs out loud)
Okay, pal... I accept the
compliment, but go easy -- my
knees start a-knocking when you
turn on the charm full blast.
MELVIN
What's with the dark?
He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.
CAROL
Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol.
My son had a full blown attack.
And this time, for extra fun, they
gave us the wrong antibiotics, so
I get him home...
She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes
nuts.
MELVIN
No... no... leave it... the
bacon's for the dog.
She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption,
but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.
MELVIN
Last week I was playing the piano
for him and he likes it, and so I
decide I'm going to make a little
joke...
CAROL
You all set here?
Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to
finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a
beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is
avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.
MELVIN
It's a beautiful day for our walk.
Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.
ON VERDELL
again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the
sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic
gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.
MELVIN
Don't be like me, don't you be
like me. You stay just the way
you are because you are a perfect
man. I'm gonna take you home and
get you something to eat... what
you love.
ANOTHER ANGLE
FEMALE PASSERSBY
(charmed)
Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like
that.
MELVIN
(all smiles to Verdell)
Let's go home and do some writing.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself
with great satisfaction as he goes.
Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his
master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing
aloud to the dog.
MELVIN
""He turned off the gas jets and
carried her outside. He kissed
her brow and when her eyes opened
and found him, he said, 'there are
easier ways to break a date.' She
laughed. The only sensible
ambition he had ever known was now
realized. He had made the girl
happy. And what a girl. 'You've
saved my life,' she said, 'you'd
better make it up to me.'""
Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine...
MELVIN
(singing to Verdell)
Done!
(playing with him some)
Yes, I hate the doggy... yes, I
hate the doggy.
He exits.
MELVIN (V.O.)
Sixty-two books... done!
As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our
couple's play time for...
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY
As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul
mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the
maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few
words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and
talk of how long Nora can stay on.
INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.
FRANK
How's Verdell doing?
MELVIN
He's a pain in the ass.
As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and,
without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's
surprise.
FRANK
Simon's home. I was sort of
hoping you could keep the dog
until he's had a chance to think
and adjust...
MELVIN
(leaping at the chance)
It's been five weeks... another
few won't kill me.
FRANK
No. He wants him back. He'll be
by tomorrow.
MELVIN
(too loudly, weirdly)
Okay by me.
Frank exits.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to
the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are
locked... checks again to make sure he turned them in the
correct direction... turns from the door... then back to
check once more. And again... and again... anguished,
until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.
INT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY
Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a
wheelchair and shudders...
MELVIN
That's some face they left hanging
on you. You look like...
SIMON
(interrupting)
Could you take it just a little
easy, Mr. Udall?
A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.
SIMON
Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart?
(to Melvin)
By the way, thanks for saving me.
MELVIN
I called. I never touched you. I
didn't leave my name or nothing.
SIMON
(not listening)
Verdell?
ON VERDELL
Totally weirded out... hiding behind Melvin... now Melvin
shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other... Simon
smiles at the dog... he is emotionally caught up in the
reunion.
SIMON
Hi, sweetheart.
Verdell isn't eager.
ON SIMON
The first gnawing pains of rejection.
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY
Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get
Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the
door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog
up.
SIMON
No. Please, don't force him.
JACKIE
(to dog)
You little stinker. He's given
you everything.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
MELVIN'S POV
Verdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl.
BACK TO SCENE
Melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and
hits a few keys... looks at Verdell's empty spot again...
there are those who ""get the joke"" -- Melvin is clearly
one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels
the panic rise in him...
... all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and
now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.
MELVIN
Over the dog... an ugly dog.
It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual
sob is choked back... he gets up -- following a definite
pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but
highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared,
beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.
EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY
Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then
turning into a building with a copper sign reading
""Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group.""
MELVIN
Worst sidewalk in New York and
look where they put in.
INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY
Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.
MELVIN
Help!
DOCTOR
If you want to see me you will not
do this. You will make an
appointment...
MELVIN
Explain to me how you can diagnose
someone as ""obsessive compulsive
disorder"" and then act like I have
any choice in barging in.
DOCTOR
There's not going to be a debate.
You must leave.
The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to
follow.
MELVIN
You said you could help me --
what was that -- a tease?
DOCTOR
I can help you if you take the
responsibility to keep regular
app --
MELVIN
(suddenly)
You changed the room around...
DOCTOR
Two years ago...
Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough
he must go through a careful exercise noting every new
element before he's at all comfortable... as he studies
each object. The Doctor is professionally intrigued
despite himself.
DOCTOR
I also regrew my beard... but
you're not interested in changes
in me... so it's like I always
told you... when it comes to
people you...
MELVIN
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this
mountain of available time... I
got to get to my restaurant on
time. Do you know how hard it is
for me to be here?
DOCTOR
Yes.
(as Melvin starts
for the office)
No.
INT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY
More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin
passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops.
Eyes on them. Then:
MELVIN
(to other patients)
What if this is as good as it
gets?
They look stricken. He exits.
INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY
As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief.
CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his
table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils
and arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT
AUTHORITY POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl
looks at his utensils.
CHERYL
What the heck are those for?
MELVIN
No. No. Get Carol.
CHERYL
I'm filling in. We don't know if
she's coming back. She might have
to get a job closer to home.
MELVIN
What are you trying to do to me?
CHERYL
What the heck do you mean?
MELVIN
Hey, elephant girl, call her or
something... just let her do my
one meal here. I'll pay whatever.
I'll wait.
(as she doesn't
budge; he screams)
Do it!!!
The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police
that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.
MANAGER
Out. Be silent or leave.
MELVIN
I'll be quiet. Just let me wait.
No problem. Get her here -- have
her get me two sausages, four
bacon, two eggs over easy and
coffee. I'm not a prick here --
I'm a great customer. This day is
a disaster. I can't handle this,
too.
MANAGER
Get out immediately or there's
going to be trouble.
Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless
situation and rises.
MELVIN
There's going to be trouble???
He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other
employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near
the door he hands him 20 dollars.
MELVIN
Carol's last name?
BUSBOY
Connelly.
EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY
An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.
MELVIN'S POV
A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever
the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of
community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving
their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local
store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.
EXT. CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY
As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DOOR/HALLWAY - DAY
Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing.
She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a
thermometer.
MELVIN
I'm hungry.
(on Carol's astonished
look)
You've upset my whole day. I
haven't eaten.
CAROL
What are you doing here?
Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge
he had imagined she might make...
MELVIN
This is not a sexist thing. If
you were a waiter I would still be
here saying...
CAROL
Are you totally gone? This is my
private home...
MELVIN
I am trying to keep emotions out of
this. Even though this is an
important issue to me and I have
strong feelings about the subject.
CAROL
What subject? That I wasn't there
to take crap from you and bring
you eggs? Do you have any control
over how creepy you allow yourself
to get?
MELVIN
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact...
and to prove it I have not gotten
personal and you have. Why aren't
you at work? You're not sick --
you don't look sick... just very
tired and bitter.
CAROL
My son is sick, okay?
Even saying the sentence, ""My son is sick"" pushes some
emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy
man at her threshold.
MELVIN
What about your mother?
CAROL
How do you know about my mother?
MELVIN
I hear you talk when I'm
waiting!!!
She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a
step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into
the room.
CAROL
Sorry, honey... I'll be right
there.
MELVIN
(uncomfortably)
How ya doing?
Spencer just stares at him.
MELVIN
(miffed)
You should answer when someone
talks to you...
Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then
emphatically gestures him to ""clear out."" Melvin backs
out the door.
CAROL
Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin,
and I can't handle you teaching
my son manners.
She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son
and leads him back to his room.
INT. SPENCER'S ROOM
CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of
Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his
ear. They both count down the seconds.
CAROL AND SPENCER
5... 4... 3... 2... 1... Bingo.
SPENCER
104.9
CAROL
We are going to treat ourselves to
a cab ride.
EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY
As Carol carries her young son through a class of
uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She
spots Melvin about to enter a cab.
CAROL
Melvin, wait!
The school kids pick up the chant in unison.
SCHOOL KIDS
Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait!
Melvin, wait!
He turns to face them.
MELVIN
Shut up, kids!
They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.
CAROL
Melvin... give us a lift. We've
got to go see our friends at the
hospital.
Melvin is thrown... he pauses a beat... then holds the
rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The
maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.
MELVIN
I'll ride up front. Cover your
mouth when you cough, kid.
INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY
As they settle in and drive off.
CAROL
Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,
please and quickly please.
EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY
As Carol enters the hospital.
CAROL
(calling back)
I owe you three dollars.
Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son...
MELVIN
Yeah, yeah... any chance you'll
get back to work today?
CAROL
(furiously)
No!!! Stay away from me!
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY
Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for
Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...
she has some index cards in her laps which she
occasionally consults and shuffles.
JACKIE
I feel terrible that I have to...
Simon? Forget about the dog for a
second.
Simon forces his attention to Jackie.
SIMON
Sorry. What are those cards?
JACKIE
(a bit embarrassed)
Frank's idea. He thought I should
have notes so I did this right...
maintained focus, didn't get
emotional and tried not to terrify
you.
SIMON
(scared shitless)
Terrify me?
JACKIE
See, he's right. I need the
cards.
(reading from cards)
Simon, you're broke.
ANGLE ON VERDELL
as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed.
JACKIE (O.S.)
The medical bill are 61 thousand
now. I've spoken to your parents
and they didn't hang up or
anything -- they just said they
would feel strange calling you.
SIMON (O.S.)
Well, I can't reach them.
Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns
for:
SIMON
(to Verdell)
Here, baby... what is it,
Verdell?... You miss the tough
guy...
(trying to be
Melvin-like)
Well, here I am, you little pissant
mop, happy to see me? How about
another ride down the chute? Oh,
God... I don't mean it,
sweetheart...
(on Jackie's look)
I'm sorry. I know...
Verdell hides behind a chair.
JACKIE
Frank loves you. You know that...
but I've spoken to him and he
feels that --
(reading from card)
-- as a businessman, with limited
resources...
SIMON
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and studio, won't I?... Just tell
me.
As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.
SIMON
(overwhelmed)
Wow...
Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet
the dog and the dog ducks.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY
He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset.
He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He
is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits.
INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY
We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening
with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering
phone calls, ""Premier Publishing.""
FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
Yes, you write more than anyone
else. Yes, you make us a lot of
money, but isn't there someone
more appropriate to...
MELVIN (O.S.)
I need this. Just say, ""Melvin,
I'll try,"" okay?
FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
(resigned)
Melvin, I'll try.
They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She
pauses at the elevator.
FEMALE EXECUTIVE
Now, on a pleasant note, our son
got accepted at Brown. My
husband...
MELVIN
(curtly)
Great, wonderful. I don't need
you to wait with me.
She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe
summons her moxie.
ZOE
I can't resist. You usually move
through here so quickly and I have
so many questions I want to ask
you. You have no idea what your
work means to me.
MELVIN
What's it mean?
ZOE
That somebody out there knows what
it's like to be...
(taps her head and heart)
in here.
MELVIN
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
ZOE
Aw come on, just a couple of
questions -- how hard is that?
As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button
etc.
ZOE
How do you write women so well?
MELVIN
(as he turns
toward her)
I think of a man and take away
reason and accountability.
The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close.
EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY
A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is
suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.
CAROL'S POV
A car at the curb with ""MD"" license plate.
BACK TO SCENE
As Carol breaks into a run.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY
As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and
jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering
sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment.
CAROL
Hello? Hello?
VOICE (O.S.)
Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here.
The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway,
her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk
on opening day of the hunting season.
INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY
CAROL
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
DR. BETTES
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes
... Dr. Bettes.
CAROL
Not your name... what are you
telling me your name for!! Where
is he?
DR. BETTES
He's in the bathroom... He's fine.
CAROL
(overlapping)
Tell me how bad it is. I let him
go out last night when it was so
cool without an overshirt -- just
and underone with just the straps
and I know better... and I let him
talk me into it. He was whining
and... you don't need this. Give
me a second to catch hold.
And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some
notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it
takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and
she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer
enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now.
Salvation as farce.
SPENCER
(to his mother)
Hi...
(they kiss)
Did you know there are doctors who
come to your house?
CAROL
No, I didn't.
(to Bettes)
So why are you h...
Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient
which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.
BEVERLY
I didn't know you had a secret
admire.
CAROL
Huh?
BEVERLY
You met the gift.
SPENCER
He's good... And I'm an expert on
doctors.
CAROL
(to Spencer)
Stay out of this... Doctor?
DR. BETTES
My wife is Melvin Udall's
publisher.
(as Carol reacts)
She says I have to take great care
of this guy because you're
urgently needed back at work.
What work do you do?
CAROL
I'm a waitress.
ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace.
BEVERLY
In Manhattan.
VOICE (O.S.)
Dr. Bettes?
DR. BETTES
In here.
A NURSE enters.
NURSE
Sorry it took so long. I don't
know Brooklyn.
DR. BETTES
It's okay, Terry.
(hands her blood
vail)
Tell the lab I'd like the report
back today.
Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity.
CAROL
You're going to get the results
today?!
MOVING SHOT
As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from
each other at a small table... soft voices... relaxation.
Bettes is examining medicine bottles.
DR. BETTES
How long has he been having
problems?
CAROL
Since forever.
DR. BETTES
Have they done blood tests on him?
CAROL
Yes.
DR. BETTES
Only in the emergency room or when
he was well.
CAROL
Emergency room only.
DR. BETTES
Have they done skin testing for
allergies?
CAROL
No.
DR. BETTES
They haven't done the standard
scratch test. Where they make
small injections into the skin?
CAROL
No. I asked. They said it's not
covered under my plan. And it's
not necessary anyway.
DR. BETTES
It's amazing these things weren't
done.
CAROL
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of
shit... I'm sorry... forgive me.
DR. BETTES
No. Actually, I think that's
their technical name.
CAROL
Once the tests come back, is there
someone I can reach in your office
for the results?
DR. BETTES
Me. My home number is on this
card.
CAROL
His home number.
Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly
has a hard time stopping.
CAROL
(to doctor)
Do you want some juice or coffee
or two female slaves?
DR. BETTES
Water... Nobody told you it might
be a good idea to remove the
carpeting and drapes in Spencer's
room?
CAROL
No.
She starts towards Spencer's room.
DR. BETTES
You don't have to do it this
second... it's not dangerous or
anything. It's just something
that's advisable. Look, there's
a lot to be checked but... Hey,
your son is going to feel a
good deal better at the very
least...
She pats his head... Then embraces him with fierce
intimacy.
CAROL
Doc!!!
(then)
So listen, you gotta let me know
about the additional costs -- one
way or the other we'll...
DR. BETTES
They're considerable. But Mr.
Udall wants to be billed.
She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY
Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained
Nora hugs him good-bye.
NORA
You poor, poor man.
SIMON
Let's use just one poor, okay?
Anyway, dear, thanks for
everything. Forgive my recent
crankiness and as soon as things
are on track again I'll call.
She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a
sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.
SIMON
What's wrong?
NORA
Who's going to walk Verdell?
Simon hadn't thought of this either.
SIMON
No, no.
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY
Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin
opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets.
MELVIN
Is he dead yet?
NORA
No! Would there be any way for
you to be willing to walk his dog
for him?
MELVIN
Absolutely.
NORA
Not just today -- Uh, could you
do it -- until, until he gets
back on his feet?
MELVIN
Sure thing.
NORA
You're a wonderful man. Two
o'clock is a good time. Here's
the key in case he's asleep. Open
the curtains for him, so he sees
God's beautiful work and knows
that even things like this happen
for the best.
MELVIN
Where'd they teach you to talk
like this -- some Panama City
""Sailor want to hump-hump bar""?
Or was today getaway day and your
last shot at his whiskey. Sell
crazy some place else -- we're all
stocked up here.
He closes the door in her face. She stands there...
thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper
shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the
elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then
continues on her way.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT
The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing.
CAROL
There is a seriously goofy man
behind this. You are not allowed
to block out that fact.
BEVERLY
Do you really want to go back to
the runt doctors in Emergency who
keep telling us they can't help?
CAROL
It lets a crazy man into our
lives.
BEVERLY
Come on. Why fight when we know
how it will come out. This isn't
like stocking or a string of
pearls. You don't send this one
back.
EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY
INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY
Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair... the PHONE RINGS.
He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that
reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult
struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he
answers.
SIMON
Hello?... yes... sure... finally,
huh? Why, ""finally""? Because I
called you so many times. Maybe
20.
(relief)
Oh, boy... I was hoping it was
something like that. You didn't
get one of them, huh? 'Cause I
mean it wasn't only your office --
it was your home, hotel and the
cigar club you like in San
Francisco. No -- Sarcastic... Of
course. I believe you. No, don't
fire anyone... Please. Maybe I'm
wrong about the 20 times. Take a
breath...
(more)
So, you miss me a little? Hey,
strike the question -- How's the
case going? Really. Fantastic.
I didn't hear. I haven't been
watching. Great. Just great.
I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me?
Well, I'm mending. No, I look
fine. Well, some of the damage
might still be noticeable if you
look closely...
He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and
beaten face...
SIMON
Carl, I need some help and you're
the logical one to turn to.
(aghast)
No! Not 'cause I blame you for
what happened. I hardly get how
you can ever think that. No, I'm
not being sarcastic.
(trying to figure it
out)
I guess because you hired the guy
who did this you think... No, I am
a sarcastic person. Well, if
you must know, the reason I said
you were the logical person is
because you always told me how you
thought I was this great person
who made you feel good about
humanity and everything. You do
remembering saying that? Well, whew.
Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but
this money thing is ridiculously
serious...
He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes
the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.
SIMON
""Will you please loan me money? I
will pay you back. I will give
you whatever percentage of my
income I don't absolutely need
until I do. It will take a while.
But I don't know what I'll do if
you say""... that.
(as he listens)
I understand... yes... No, I do.
(a bit of boldness)
But you know, you know -- you
didn't even ask how much, Carl?
Well, Frank has no right to
discuss how much I'm in hock...
no, you're right -- not the point.
So... what have you been up to???
Uh-huh... Oh, the group show...
how was it? Well, I'm not
surprised that there's that much
talent around... great... Look --
gotta go... no, you shouldn't feel
that way at all... take care, you,
too... you, too... Good-bye.
(as he hangs up)
Pal o' mine.
It's very quiet.
LONG SHOT - SIMON
A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his
face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional
release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous
with the moment of catharsis...
... but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the
CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to
focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering
the room.
MELVIN
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
SIMON
Thank you for walking him.
Simon wheels away from Melvin.
SIMON
If you'll excuse me I'm not
feeling so well.
MELVIN
It smells like shit in here?
SIMON
Go away.
MELVIN
That cleaning woman doesn't...
SIMON
Please, just leave.
MELVIN
Where are all your queer party
friends?
SIMON
(his first shout)
Get out.
Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon
with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?
SIMON
Nothing worse than having to feel
this way in front of you?
MELVIN
Nellie, you're a disgrace to
depression.
SIMON
Rot in hell, Melvin.
MELVIN
No need to stop being a lady...
quit worrying -- you'll be back on
your knees in no time.
Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden
attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.
SIMON
Is this fun for you? Well, you
lucky devil... It just gets better
and better. I am losing my
apartment and Frank wants me to
promise to paint hotter subjects
and to beg my parents, who haven't
called, for help... and I won't.
And I don't want to paint anymore.
Melvin has made for the door... Simon blocks him.
SIMON
So the life I was trying for is
over. The life I had is gone and
I am feeling so damn sorry for
myself that it is difficult to
breathe. Right times for you --
huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is
terrified...
(a sudden screamed
word surprises them
both)
Terrified... Lucky you, you're
here for rock bottom... me
wallowing in self-pity in front of
you, you absolute horror of a
human being...
As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with
discomfort.
MELVIN
Well, I'll do one thing for you
that might cheer you up.
SIMON
Get out.
MELVIN
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy.
You want to know why the dog
prefers me... it's not affection.
It's a trick.
Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's
rapt... Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.
MELVIN
I carry bacon in my pocket.
SIMON
(pleased)
Oh, my gosh.
MELVIN
(hands him bacon)
Now we'll both call him.
SIMON
Come on, sweetheart...
MELVIN
Yo, yo, yo...
Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally
surprised and staggered by the implications. True love
and such.
SIMON
Would you leave now, please?
MELVIN
Stupid dog.
(to Simon)
I don't get it.
He exits... looking apologetically at Simon in stoic
ruin.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Carol in bed on the pullout sofa... She is in turmoil...
there is THUNDER, but no rain. She walks to the kitchen.
She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits.
INT. BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT
The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol
shares a closet with her mother, who is now asleep.
Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving
her nightgown on the floor. There is something sexy
here, the woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer
dress -- no time for underwear.
EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT
Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.
EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM
Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on
her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the
subject.
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING -
NIGHT (RAIN)
Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the
rains come... We are in a familiar neighborhood.
ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE
As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on
it.
INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN)
As she enters building and realizes it's not just that
she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet
T-shirt contest... the fabric clinging to her breasts,
like the old movie poster of The Deep.
INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
As Carol passes Simon's door... stands in front of
Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness
and knocks on the door... then RINGS the BELL. Finally
Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side
of the door.
CAROL
Uh, Udall?
MELVIN (O.S.)
Carol the waitress?
CAROL
Yes.
As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her
breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it
straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is
static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it
self-conscious pats.
CAROL
The doctors had your billing
address. I'm sorry about the
hour.
MELVIN
I was working... can't you just
drop me a thank-you note?
CAROL
That's not why I'm here...
(tearing suddenly)
... though you have no idea what
it's like to have a real
conversation with a doctor about
Spencer...
MELVIN
(very uncomfortable)
Note. Put it in the note.
CAROL
Why did yo do this for me?
MELVIN
To get you back at work so you can
wait on me.
CAROL
But you do have some idea how
strange that sounds??? I'm
worried that you did this
because...
She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long
silence. Finally.
MELVIN
You waiting for me to say
something?
(as she shakes her head)
What sort of thing do you want?
Look, I'll be at the restaurant
tomorrow.
CAROL
I don't think I can wait until
tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
MELVIN
What needs clearing up?
CAROL
(strong and true)
I'm not going to sleep with you.
I will never, ever sleep with you.
Never. Not ever.
Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the
brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to
scream --
-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt
during his half turn away from her -- and then answer
hoarsely.
MELVIN
I'm sorry. We don't open for the
no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.
Carol is amused, surprised... maybe, in some small way
ever taken by his style... but top priority is clarity.
CAROL
I'm not kidding.
MELVIN
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
CAROL
Just how grateful I am.
Her mission completed -- she turns.
MELVIN
So you'll be at work?
CAROL
Yes.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's
night stand tell us... He gets up -- the first time we've
seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor
twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his
body angles from the bed in a deliberate way.
He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays
very briefly... Stops -- wipes some sweat from his
forehead... Walks to his computer room -- turns the light
on and then quickly off... Walks to his refrigerator...
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR -
NIGHT
As he grabs a cardboard take-out box...
INT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT.
He knocks of Simon's door... It opens quickly.
SIMON'S APARTMENT
MELVIN
I took a chance you were up.
Simon walks painfully back to a chair.
MELVIN
I brought you Chinese soup.
SIMON
Thanks.
MELVIN
I have never been so tired in my
life. Okay, if I sit here?
SIMON
Got any easier questions?
Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.
MELVIN
I haven't been sleeping. I
haven't been clear or felt like
myself. I'm in trouble. Some son
of a bitch is burning my bridges
behind my back... But the
tiredness -- boy... Not just
sleepy.
SIMON
But sick -- nauseous -- where
everything looks distorted and
everything inside just aches --
when you can barely get up the
will to complain.
MELVIN
(brightening)
Yeah...
He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to
take it from here.
MELVIN
I'm glad we did this.
He rises and makes an awkward exit.
MELVIN
Good talking to you.
He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Carol seated working on a letter... She is trying to
express her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed
pages sit next to her... She is so involved she doesn't
even look up as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and
is let in by Beverly.
They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly
hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over
Carol's shoulder -- ""I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and
emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my
conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how
gratefull (sic)... ""
BEVERLY
You're not still writing that
thank-you note?
CAROL
I'm on the last page. How do you
spell conscience?
BEVERLY
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean
from the bakery to baby-sit so
let's go out.
CAROL
I still don't feel safe leaving
Spencer with someone. How do you
spell it again?
BEVERLY
Spencer is okay. You'd better
start finding something else to do
with your free time. If you can't
feel good about this break and
step out a little...
(struts and pumps
her arms)
You ought to get Mr. Udall to send
you over a psychiatrist.
CAROL
(more emotionally
than she intended)
I don't need one 'cause I know
what's really going on here. I
have to finish this letter or
I'll go nuts.
(looking at paper;
weepy)
This can't be right -- con-
science.
Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself
on the brink of crying.
BEVERLY
Carol. What?
Carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able
to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she
looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission
for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol
-- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.
CAROL
I don't know... It's very strange
not feeling that stupid panic
thing inside you all the time.
Without that you just start
thinking about yourself -- and
what does that ever get anybody.
Today, on the bus there was this
adorable couple and I felt myself
giving them a dirty look -- I had
no idea everything was...
BEVERLY
Go ahead.
CAROL
(great, forceful
hand gestures)
... moving in the wrong
direction... Away from when I
even remembered what it was like
to have a man to... anything...
hold fucking -- sorry -- hands
with, for Christ's sake. I was
feeling like really bad that Dr.
Bettes is married.
(this next one's
tough)
Which is probably why I make poor
Spencer hug me more than he wants
to... Like the poor kid doesn't
have enough problems. He has to
make up for his mom not getting
any.
(weeps at her
insight)
Oh, boy. Who needs these
thoughts?
BEVERLY
Spencer's doing fine. So what are
you saying, that you're frustr...
CAROL
Leave me be! Why are you doing
this? Why are you picking at my
sores... What is it that you
want?... You want what? What's
with you? I hope getting me
thinking of everything that's
wrong when all I want is to not
do this has some purpose.
(puffy; red;
furious)
What is it, Mom? No kidding.
Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked
husky voiced question.
CAROL
What is it you want? What?
BEVERLY
I want us to go out.
A beat, then.
CAROL
(simply)
Okay.
INT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT
As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their
cry.
CAROL
(to Sean)
We're going out.
SEAN
(looking at their
red eyes)
Looks like fun.
She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what
he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting.
CAROL
Okay -- we're out of here. I love
you.
Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol
as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading.
Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself,
going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then
to her son to ask:
CAROL
Do you love me?
SPENCER
Uh-huh.
Carol exits.
EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY
Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A
simple and unprecedented experience in their recent
lives.
BEVERLY
Nice to get out, isn't it?
Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each
other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.
INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY
As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her
14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated
at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa
keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages.
CAROL
Don't get it wet.
Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.
CAROL
So it's okay?
LISA
You almost have me liking him.
You sure come from the heart. I
never knew what you went through
with everything.
CAROL
I wanted him to know how much he'd
done.
(looking over)
Can you believe he's eating with
someone.
ON MELVIN & FRANK
MELVIN
It's not my dog and this Simon
seems to have enough on his mind
-- but he did throw up twice and
his spark is off.
FRANK
Sure -- take him to the vet.
MELVIN
I did. And his stomach is out of
whack. So they need him for a
couple of days.
FRANK
Do it.
CAROL
Melvin.
She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.
MELVIN
What's this?
CAROL
(sotto)
A thank-you note for what you did
for me.
He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and
walks back to the service area where, embarrassed,
confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note.
After Carol leaves...
FRANK
She's nice.
MELVIN
(to Frank)
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a
good thing... telling someone,
'no thanks required.'
FRANK
It looks like it really went over.
You're sure making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup
last night. I hope he doesn't
write you a note.
Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing
message.
FRANK
What?
MELVIN
""What?"" Look at you... You sense
a mark.
FRANK
Hey -- you called me... I...
MELVIN
About a dog.
FRANK
Yeah, but it's all about Simon
now... you helped with the dog...
And now there are other things.
I'm just as concerned as you are
about Simon.
MELVIN
Concerned. I'm just the hall
monitor here.
FRANK
It's not only financial
assistance. What he's got to do
is go to Baltimore tomorrow and
ask his parents for money. It's
not going to happen on the phone.
MELVIN
Yeah. If his parents are alive
they've got to help -- those are
the rules. Good.
FRANK
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high
maintenance selling painter coming
through... So I'm out. Can you
take him?
MELVIN
Think white and get serious.
Carol enters scene.
FRANK
Take my car -- a convertible. Do
you drive?
MELVIN
(loudly)
Like the wind but I'm not doing
it.
CAROL
Getting loud, getting loud.
MELVIN
He wants me to take his car and
his client to Baltimore.
CAROL
I want your life for a minute
where my big problem is someone
offers me a free convertible so I
can get out of this city.
She exits. Frank prepares to depart.
MELVIN
Okay. I'll take him. Get him
packed -- ready -- tomorrow
morning.
Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.
MELVIN
(excited)
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out. We don't
enjoy another that much.
FRANK
If there's some mental health
foundation that raises money to
help people like you be sure to
let me know.
MELVIN
Last word freak.
Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a
""good-bye"" to him.
CAROL
So. Anything else?
MELVIN
Yes. I'm going to give my queer
neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
CAROL
Okay.
MELVIN
Hey, what I did for you is working
out?
CAROL
(a breath; then)
What you did changed my life.
She offers him the note.
MELVIN
No... no thank you notes.
CAROL
Well, part of what I said in this
entire history of my life which
you won't read is that somehow
you've done more for my mother, my
son and me, than anyone else ever
has... And that makes you the most
important, surprising, generous
person I've ever met and that you
be in our daily prayers forever.
MELVIN
Lovely.
CAROL
I also wrote one part... I wrote
I'm sorry... I was talking about I
was sorry when I got mad at you
when you came over and you told my
son that he ought to answer back
so I wrote that.
(reading from the
letter, Melvin
wildly uncomfortable)
I was sorry for busting you on
that... and I'm sorry for busting
in on you that night... when I
said I was never... I was sorry
and I'm sorry every time your food
was cold and that you had to wait
two seconds for a coffee filler...
Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it --
emotionally moved by her own words.
CAROL
... and I'm sorry for never
spotting, right there at the table
in the restaurant, the human being
that had it in him to do this
thing for us... You know what, I'm
just going to start from the
beginning... I have not been able
to express my gratefulness to
you... even as I look at the word
""grateful"" now it doesn't begin to
tell you what I feel for you...
And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.
MELVIN
Nice of you... thank you.
CAROL
Thank you.
MELVIN
Now I want you to do something for me.
She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.
CAROL
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say,
""what?"" I thought I said,
""what?""... What?
MELVIN
I want you to go on this trip.
CAROL
No, sir...
MELVIN
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid
he'll pull the stiff one eye on
me. I need you to chaperon.
Separate everything but cars. You
said you liked convertibles. Now
I'm on the hook.
CAROL
The stiff one eye?
MELVIN
Two days.
CAROL
I can't. I work.
MELVIN
You take off when you have to.
CAROL
My son.
MELVIN
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
CAROL
(no other way)
Melvin, I'd rather not.
MELVIN
What's that got to do with it?
CAROL
Funny, I thought it was a strong
point.
MELVIN
Write me a note and ain't she
sweet. I need a hand and where'd
she go.
CAROL
Are you saying accepting your help
obligates me!?
MELVIN
Is there another way to see it?
CAROL
No.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf
of the closet.
CAROL
Well, here's a little suitcase
shocked that it's been used.
She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's
too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another
drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries
of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.
INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER
Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday
""girl Jockies."" She fingers the good stuff -- puts it
back -- then the everyday -- hesitates.
CAROL
(furiously exasperated)
There's not way to pack for this
trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm
not packing the camera.
As she exits the room --
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
As she picks up the phone.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly
stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a
camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items --
underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each
one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds
another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing
development. He has almost no recent experience with
receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little
comment to himself as he moves.
MELVIN
Woo-woo.
He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is
-- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but
before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his
throat.
ON CAROL
As she hears his throat being cleared. It is not a
pretty sound. (The following conversation is INTERCUT.)
CAROL
Hello?
MELVIN
Are you still coming?
CAROL
Yes.
Melvin visibly relaxes.
CAROL
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly
where we are going.
MELVIN
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland.
So I know what you're going to ask
next.
(correcting himself)
That you might ask -- I'm not
certain.
CAROL
There's... there's no need to
bring anything dressy... or... I
mean -- I didn't know if we'd be
eating at any restaurant that
have dress codes.
MELVIN
Oh.
(a beat)
We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
CAROL
Okay, gotcha. What did you think
I was going to ask?
MELVIN
Whether crabs are in season there
now...
CAROL
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good
night.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.
BEVERLY
How was it talking to him?
CAROL
Stop treating this like I'm going
away with a man. He's just going
to say those crappy, sick,
complaining, angry things to me.
I hate this, Mom -- I hate this.
He's a freak show -- the worst
person I ever met.
BEVERLY
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches.
She kisses them.
CAROL
(to Spencer)
You stand there and I'll wave to
you from the back window.
As she boards the bus.
BEVERLY
Call me as soon as you're settled.
CAROL
(to Spencer)
I love you.
The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them
open.
CAROL
(to bus driver)
Sensitive, huh?!
The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at
his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing
himself.
INT. VETERINARIAN'S WAITING ROOM - DAY
A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as
Melvin finishes filling out some forms.
On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black
dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.
VETERINARIAN
Anything unusual in the dog's
diet?
MELVIN
No. Everybody gets their own
cage?
VETERINARIAN
Certainly.
MELVIN
(pointing to
Chihuahua)
Put him in with that one, not that
one...
(pointing to large
dog)
... Builds his confidence.
EXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY
Carol disembarks.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY
As she walks and turns a corner.
CLOSE ON CAROL
The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death
chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do
not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison ""screws""
will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect
couldn't be grimmer.
CAROL'S POV
Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.
CLOSER ON MELVIN
He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the
tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the
building.
FRANK
I'm sorry that I'm not taking
you.
SIMON
(upset)
So am I, Frank.
Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.
MELVIN
Soak it up -- it's your last
chance at a hug for a few days.
As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor
changes... that quickly there is a shyness.
CAROL
Hi.
MELVIN
Thanks for being on time... Carol,
the waitress, this is Simon, the
fag.
CAROL
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that
to you?
SIMON
I, uh... I was... attacked.
Walked in on people robbing me. I
was hospitalized. I almost died.
MELVIN
Let's do the small talk in the
car. Load up.
Carol puts her bag in the car.
MELVIN
I was going to do that for you.
CAROL
(taken aback)
It's okay. No problem. Where
should we sit?
MELVIN
(totally non-plussed)
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no
place cards or anything.
CAROL
(to Simon)
Let me go in back. You look like
you need all the room you can
manage.
SIMON
That's very thoughtful.
MELVIN
Never a break. Never.
Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's
not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small
back seat. She struggles to get her feet in.
MELVIN
You're really jammed back there.
He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his
seat and, with some effort, wrenches it forward giving
Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel.
She is startled by the gesture.
CAROL
Thanks, Melvin.
MELVIN
Welcome.
And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.
EXT. 12TH STREET
Turning onto Fifth.
MELVIN
I got the whole ride programmed.
CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all
carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the
one marked ""ICEBREAKER."" It is a song which we clearly
and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick
burst of ""Y.M.C.A."" Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.
MELVIN
Just wanted to see what you'd do.
No, we have greatness here.
He goes for another CD labelled ""FOR USE TO REP THINGS
UP.""
The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY
SELECTED MUSIC.
CAROL (O.S.)
Hey, I like this music.
And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.
EXT. ROAD - DAY
The three of them... Carol chattering away.
CAROL
I don't know the last time I've
been out of the city... Hey, my
arms are tanning. I used to tan
great. We gotta stop soon so'se
I can check on Spencer.
SIMON
(during the above)
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I
can't turn my head all the way
yet... tell her we can't hear her.
MELVIN
Doesn't matter. She's enjoying
herself. Consider it part of the
music.
EXT. ROAD - DAY
A short time later. Carol is now driving.
CAROL
I'm sure, Simon, they did
something real off for you to feel
this way... But when it comes to
your partners -- or your kid --
things will always be off for you
unless you set it straight. Maybe
this thing happened to you just to
give you that chance.
MELVIN
Nonsense!
CAROL
Anybody here who's interested in
what Melvin has to say raise their
hands.
Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus
declared their majority.
SIMON
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents?
CAROL
Yes. I really would.
SIMON
Well...
CAROL
No, let me pull over so I can pay
full attention.
Car pulling over toward parking spot.
EXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY
She takes the car curbside and parks.
CAROL
Now go ahead.
Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks
innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something
-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.
SIMON
Well, I always painted. Always.
And my mother always encouraged
it. She was sort of fabulous
about it actually... and she used
to... I was too young to think
there was anything at all wrong
with it... and she was very
natural. She used to pose nude
for me... and I thought or assumed
my father was aware of it.
MELVIN
This stuff is pointless.
CAROL
Hey -- you let him...
MELVIN
You like sad stories -- you want
mine.
CARL
. Go ahead, Simon. Really.
Please. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.
SIMON
Okay. Well, one day my father
came in on one of those painting
sessions when I was nine -- and he
just started screaming at her --
at us -- at evil. And...
MELVIN
(very quickly)
... my father didn't leave his
room for 11 years -- he hit my
hand with a yardstick if I made a
mistake on the piano.
CAROL
Go ahead, Simon. Your father
walked in on you and was yelling
and... really, come on.
SIMON
I was trying to defend my mother
and make peace, in the lamest way.
I said, ""she's not naked -- it's
art."" And then he started hitting
me. And he beat me unconscious.
After that he talked to me less
and less -- he knew before I left
for college, my dad came into my
room. He held out his hand. It
was filled with money. A big wad
of sweaty money.
(gathers himself)
And he said to me, ""I don't want
you to ever come back."" I grabbed
him and I hugged him... He turns
and walked out.
Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as
strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so
much more complicated than her meat and potatoes
troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her
fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice,
understated, gesture of friendship.
CAROL
Well, you know -- I still stay
what I said. You've got to get
past it all when it comes to your
parents. We all have these horror
stories to get over.
Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.
MELVIN
That's not true. Some of us have
great stories... pretty stories
that take place at lakes with
boats and friends and noodle
salad. Just not anybody in this
car. But lots of people -- that's
their story -- good times and
noodle salad... and that's what
makes it hard. Not that you had
it bad but being that pissed that
so many had it good.
CAROL
No.
SIMON
Not it at all, really.
MELVIN
(a veteran's irony)
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to
the hotel. And if you're lucky
tomorrow Dad will give you another
wad of sweaty money.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY
MELVIN
Two bedrooms and the sofa opens...
Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.
CAROL
(to Simon)
No answer... Maybe we should just
drive there tomorrow. Can I have
that one?
MELVIN
Yes... sure.
(to Simon)
I'll take the sofa.
Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever
have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials...
CAROL
(into phone)
Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are
you out of breath? You did?!?
That is great... So great... So --
no, wait a second, Spence...
INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially
neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.
MELVIN
Can I ask you a personal question?
Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.
MELVIN
Do you ever get an erection for a
woman?
SIMON
Melvin...
MELVIN
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier
if you were not...
SIMON
You consider your life easy.
MELVIN
I give you that one...
(eyes suitcase)
Nice packing.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting
there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new
factors in her life.
CAROL
My son was outside playing soccer.
I never saw him playing ball. Come
on, you guys -- take me out for a
good time... Take me out dancing.
MELVIN
Dancing?
SIMON
I can't, I'm exhausted.
Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is
visibly disturbed by her gesture.
CAROL
(to Simon)
I don't blame you... This is a
monumental first day out... You
sad or anything?
SIMON
No... Nervous. It would be very
rough, Carol, if you weren't
along.
CAROL
What a nice compliment.
She gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy.
She turns to him.
CAROL
I'm happy. And you're my date.
Let's get dressed.
She exits the room. Melvin unnerved.
MELVIN
I'm going to jump in the shower.
I'll be right with you.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main
room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she
sits down to wait -- through...
SERIES OF DISSOLVES
Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until
finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom
through a cloud of steam. They exit.
EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
As they drive up.
VALET
Good evening, sir.
MELVIN
They sell hard shell crabs here?
VALET
Yes.
INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
As they enters...
HEAD WAITER
Good evening.
MELVIN
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
CAROL
Stop asking everyone.
MELVIN
Just him and that's it. Okay, you
can answer -- we've worked it out.
HEAD WAITER
Yes, we do... And I can give you a
tie and jacket.
MELVIN
What?
HEAD WAITER
They require a tie and jacket but
we have some available.
He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them.
MELVIN
No... I'm not wearing that -- and
just in case you were going to ask
I'm not going to let you inject me
with plaque either.
CAROL
You promised a nice place -- can't
you just...
(to Head Waiter)
You have these dry cleaned all the
time, don't you?
HEAD WAITER
Actually, I don't think so.
MELVIN
(to Carol)
Wait here.
EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.
EXT. STREET - SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT
As the car goes right across the street to a shopping
mall.
INT. SHOPPING MALL - MEN'S STORE - NIGHT
Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.
SALESMAN
Good evening.
MELVIN
I need a coat and tie.
OTHER ANGLE
CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so
that passage for Melvin is impossible.
SALESMAN
Come on in.
MELVIN
No.
SALESMAN
No?
MELVIN
(pointing)
That jacket and give me a tie.
EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.
VALET #2
Good evening.
MELVIN
You have hard shells?
VALET #2
I'm not sure.
MELVIN
Everyone else says you do.
VALET #2
Then I guess we do.
INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT
As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is
having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool --
watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning
down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin
watches... Watches his date.
HEAD WAITER
Shall I get her for you?
MELVIN
No, it's all right. I'll just
watch.
He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns
-- Melvin makes a ""Haul your ass over here"" gesture...
and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has
lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her.
She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables,
giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g.
She notices the waiter in her trail.
CAROL
(mouthing the words
to Melvin)
My drink is following me.
Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite.
He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.
CAROL
You look s...
She stops herself from saying ""sexy,"" regathers, then...
CAROL
You look great.
They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her.
CAROL
You wanna dance?
MELVIN
I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.
CAROL
(rising)
And?
MELVIN
No...
(and before she can
digest that)
... I don't get this place. They
make me buy an outfit but they let
you wear a house dress. I don't
get it.
ON CAROL
Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in
extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave.
MELVIN
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't
mean it. You gotta sit down. You
can still give me the dirty
look... just sit down and give it
to me.
CAROL
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I
need one and quick... You have no
idea how much what you said just
hurt my feelings.
MELVIN
(really pissed,
mutters)
That monominute somebody gets that
you need them they threaten to go
away. Never fails.
CAROL
That's not compliment, Melvin...
That's just trying to sound smart
so I feel stupid... A compliment
is something nice about somebody
else... Now or never.
MELVIN
Okay.
He waves her down.
CAROL
(sitting)
And mean it...
MELVIN
Can we order first?
She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room.
This does not stop Melvin.
MELVIN
(calling)
Two crab dinners and pitcher of
cold beer.
(to Carol)
Baked or fries?
CAROL
Fries.
MELVIN
(calling)
One baked -- one fries.
STARTLED WAITER
(shouting back)
I'll tell your waiter.
MELVIN
(to Carol)
Okay, I got a real great
compliment for you and it's true.
CAROL
I am so afraid you're about to say
something awful...
MELVIN
Don't be pessimistic. It's not
your style. Okay... Here I
goes... Clearly a mistake.
(this is hell
for him)
I have this -- what? Ailment...
And my doctor -- a shrink... who
I used to see all the time... he
says 50 or 60 percent of the time
a pill can really help. I hate
pills. Very dangerous things,
pills. ""Hate,"" I am using the
word ""hate"" about pills. My
compliment is that when you came
to my house that time and told me
how you'd never -- well, you were
there, you know... The next
morning I started taking these
pills.
CAROL
(a little confused)
I don't quite get how that's a
compliment for me.
Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion --
so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly --
then:
MELVIN
You make me want to be a better
man.
Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so
slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered,
momentarily moved and his for the taking.
CAROL
That's maybe the best compliment
of my life.
MELVIN
Then I've really overshot here
'cause I was aiming at just enough
to keep you from walking out.
Carol laughs.
CAROL
So how are you doing with those
pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
MELVIN
Takes months to know... They work
little by little.
(holds his head;
then)
Talking like this is exhausting.
Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very
close -- he tenses.
CAROL
Have you ever let a romantic
moment make you do something you
know is stupid?
MELVIN
Never.
CAROL
Here's the trouble with never.
TIGHT SHOT
for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at
him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him
-- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves
away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But
now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is
brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself.
Melvin can't bear the pleasure.
MELVIN
You don't owe me that.
CAROL
That wasn't payment. When you
first came into breakfast, when I
saw you -- I thought you were
handsome... Then, of course, you
spoke... So now that your soft
li'l underbelly is all exposed.
Tell me, why did you bring me?
Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable...
as he holds up his hands in a ""stop"" signal.
MELVIN
Well, ah... that's a personal
question.
CAROL
Tell me even if you're scared.
Tell me why you wanted me here.
It's okay.
She kisses him again.
CAROL
If you ask me... I'll say, ""yes.""
MELVIN
(dissembling)
There are lots of reason... I had
a thought that if you had sex with
Simon it might...
CAROL
(humiliated)
Sex with Simon?
MELVIN
It's one idea...
CAROL
That's why you brought me? Look
at me! Is that really why you
brought me... Like I'm a what and
I owe you what?!
MELVIN
I don't know why I brought you --
that idea occurred to me is all...
It came out first... Hey, you kiss
him -- me... He says he loves
you. You two hit it off. But you
don't want to... fine... Forget
what I said about sex with Simon.
It was a mistake.
CAROL
(wiping away tears)
I'll never forget you said it.
MELVIN
It was a mistake.
But she has already turned away and exits the
restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable.
INT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not
breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let
the anxiety immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice,
then a humorless male voice:
PARENTS' VOICE
(humorless male
voice)
Hi. This is Fred Bishop...
(perky woman's
voice)
... and Betty.
(Fred again)
We are sorry to be unable to take
your call right now. Please leave
a message and we'd appreciate your
including the time/date and
purpose of your call.
(Simon mouths the
word ""date,"" then
Betty speaks before
the beep Bye-bye.
SIMON
Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in
town...
(he waits)
... and, folks, you haven't come
home later than 10 in your lives.
Please pick up -- really...
Okay... I'm going to call again in
the morning. I need to see you.
Or, at least get you to answer the
phone.
He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he
needs help.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT
As Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she
goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing
things in.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT
SIMON
Hello... Hello???
Carol thrusts open the door and enters...
SIMON
Was this supposed to be your room?
CAROL
Our room. I don't want to see him
and he's not going to come
knocking on your door.
Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him,
inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.
SIMON
Can you not be violent?
CAROL
I don't think so. You need help
with the pants?
SIMON
(emphatically)
No!!!
CAROL
I'm going to take a big bath and
order a big meal.
SIMON
Uh-huh...
CAROL
I'm sorry... are you okay?
SIMON
Well, considering everything's
horrible and tomorrow I have to
face my parents... Don't ask me
... I'm sick of my own complaints
... got to get me a new set of
thoughts.
CAROL
Why? What have you been thinking
about?
SIMON
How to die, mostly.
CAROL
Can you believe in our little mix
you're the good roommate.
Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins
to prepare a bath.
SIMON
(turning off the light)
Good night.
CAROL
Good night.
We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or
sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he
faces the bathroom and we have...
SIMON'S POV
Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now
as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair
-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast
exposed...
BACK TO SCENE
SIMON
(a whisper)
Hold it.
He leaves the bed.
ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK
What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set
and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair
and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of
the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.
SIMON
I've got to sketch you.
CAROL
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer
than you think. I give the wrong
impression sometimes and...
SIMON
I haven't even been thinking about
sketching for weeks.
CAROL
Stop staring. Do a vase.
SIMON
But you're beautiful... your skin
glows.
CAROL
Thanks. But I just want to take a
bath and...
SIMON
That long neck -- the line of
you... you're porcelain... your
back goes on forever. You're
classic... you're why cavemen
chiseled on walls...
CAROL
All right, cut me a break.
Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him
earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly
but deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right.
She's breathtaking.
INT. BAR - NIGHT
Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to
the bartender.
MELVIN
So then, the next thing I know,
she's sitting right next to me,
and then, well, it's not right to
go into the details, but I screwed
up. I got nervous. I said the
wrong thing and if I hadn't, I
could be in bed now with a woman
who if you could make her smile
you got a life. Instead, I'm here
with you, no offense, a moron
pushing the last legal drug.
He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his
heart breaking.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SIMON - NIGHT
He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.
CAROL (O.S.)
I don't care how you put it --
We're being naughty here, pal.
FULL SHOT
Carol holding a pose for Simon... He is holding a
ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His
style cramped by his cast.
SIMON
No. No. This is great, this is
so great. I can't get the angle
with this cast.
He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle
no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece
from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically --
a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Melvin is having a room service breakfast.
The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better
than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.
MELVIN
Did you have sex with her?
Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the
hotel soaps, shampoos, etc.
MELVIN
Sorry, didn't realize she was
right there.
(a beat)
Did you have sex with her?
CAROL
To hell with sex.
Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze.
CAROL
We held each other. It was better
than sex. What I need he gave me
great.
SIMON
I just love her.
(beat)
How're you doing?
Melvin reacts.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:
SIMON
Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely
hear you. Do you have to whisper?
No -- don't apologize -- it was
the luckiest thing for all of us
that you didn't answer last
night... I can't hear you... okay,
dear, just listen to me then.
ON MELVIN AND CAROL
Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings
the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in
her suitcase.
MELVIN
I get why you're angry. It's no
snap to explain why I was like
that, but let's not try to do it
on the run...
SIMON
... so Mom. Truly no grudges --
truly. A little odd that you
didn't come to see me when you
heard I was hurt, but the
important thing I want you to know
is your son is happy. I'm working
again. I'll make do -- I don't
want a thing. Wouldn't take it if
it was offered. I'll drop you a
note from wherever I land and then
it's up to you. I hope we patch
things up but know that if we
don't, I wish you both the very
best... I can't hear you. You
heard me, though, right? Good --
take good care. 'Bye.
He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over
to Carol and Melvin.
MELVIN
... Now he's going to want to
stay. And they'll want to take a
ride to the lake or whatever. So
it's a good five hours back. It
gives us a chance to take it easy
and...
SIMON
I'm going back with you.
CAROL
But what about...
SIMON
I'll take care of myself --
MELVIN
What are you talking about? You
got real problems.
SIMON
I know. I'm a little bit nervous.
Suddenly everything seems so easy.
Carol, a load has been lifted.
CAROL
One night with me!
SIMON
You think you're kidding.
Melvin stalks out.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
The car parked near a phone booth --
MELVIN
(to Frank over
the phone)
Aww Jesus! No choice.
Carol walks up to Simon in the car.
CAROL
I got a gift for you.
She hands him a base ball cap.
MELVIN
(on phone)
Nothing like no choice to make you
feel at home.
CAROL
(to Simon)
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
MELVIN
Do it then. Get the dog picked
up. I can't believe you let it
stay there.
Melvin hangs up the phone.
MELVIN
Good-bye.
(to Simon)
Well, your luck is holding. They
sublet your place. You're
homeless. Frank's got a line on
another place you can use for now.
SIMON
Another place where?
MELVIN
Does it matter?
Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a
special CD labelled ""For Emergency Use Only."" As it
PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:
CAROL
I don't want to hear that music
right now.
MELVIN
What do you mean? You said you
liked it.
CAROL
I don't.
MELVIN
This one has a special meaning.
CAROL
It's your car but I don't want to
hear it. If that means anything.
Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
proclamation of love.
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT
As the car arrives... They get out...
MELVIN
Here are the keys to my apartment.
I'm going to park you in my place
while I take Carol home.
CAROL
(hefting bag)
I'll take a bus.
MELVIN
I'll take you... why not?
CAROL
I don't care what you did for me.
I don't think I want to know you
anymore -- all you do is make me
feel badly about myself.
(turning to Simon)
You have my number.
SIMON
(hugging her)
I love you...
(sotto)
Let him take you home.
CAROL
Don't want to. I love you.
She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at
Melvin with some sympathy.
MELVIN
Don't say anything.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Where Verdell's ears prick.
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
As they enter.
MELVIN (O.S.)
I told you to go on in.
SIMON (O.S.)
Look, I've got to get a hold of
Frank and see where I'm hanging my
hat 'cause...
The door opens, revealing them:
MELVIN
I think you gotta camp it here...
SIMON
What are you talking about?
The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the
dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.
SIMON
(to Verdell)
I know the feeling -- you feel
like your ol' self again, huh? --
Mommy and Daddy are home.
Melvin reacts.
SIMON
Sorry... You're fun to mess with.
Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.
MELVIN
They took your place furnished.
Jackie said she grabbed your
personal stuff -- they were
supposed to set you up here.
(leading the way)
There's this extra room -- I
never use. It gets good light.
No other answer really.
Simon follows.
INT. SIMON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT
As they enter... the room clean and organized -- a small
but lovely garret.
SIMON
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm
me.
MELVIN
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
SIMON
I love you.
Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.
MELVIN
I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the
luckiest guy alive if that did it
for me.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and
Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each
around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully
dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we
hear Simon's whispered voice.
SIMON (O.S.)
Where is my big hairy boy?
Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay houseguest
approaches.
SIMON (O.S.)
Verdell, sweeties?
Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.
SIMON
Sorry, didn't know you were awake.
I just thought Verdell shouldn't
get too used to sleeping in here
'cause then...
MELVIN
Look, we both want the dog --
and...
The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin
doesn't move.
SIMON
Should I get it?
Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several
beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:
SIMON (O.S.)
Hello.
ON SIMON
SIMON
(into phone)
Hello. It's me. He took me in.
Did you know? Hold on, I'll get
him for you.
He walks back to Melvin's room.
INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT
As he enters.
SIMON
It's Carol.
Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one
mitt... he thrusts it at Simon.
MELVIN
Here. Take the dog.
As he speeds him out...
SIMON
Good luck.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat
loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin
-- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat
clearing.
MELVIN
Hello.
CAROL
Yeah... Well...
MELVIN
(very concerned)
How you doing?
CAROL
I can trust my brain.
MELVIN
That seems like a good choice.
CAROL
I don't know whether I'm being
sensible or hard on you.
MELVIN
The two might go together.
CAROL
See. There's an example. I don't
know whether you're being cute or
crazy now.
MELVIN
(what the hell)
Cute.
CAROL
You don't have to answer
everything I say. Just listen to
me. Okay?
He nods his head, ""yes.""
CAROL
It's really something that you're
looking after Simon. And what I
said on the street. That was a
bad thing to say. And it made me
sick to my stomach. It was a bad
thing to say. And I'd be lying if
I didn't say that I enjoyed your
company... but the truth is you do
bother me enormously and I know --
think -- that it's best for me to
not have contact with you because
you're just not ready and you're a
pretty old guy to not be ready...
and I'm too old to ignore that.
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place.
So thanks for the trips...
She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than
ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.
MELVIN
Okay to say something now?
CAROL
Go ahead.
MELVIN
I should've danced with you.
CAROL
Okay. Good-bye.
MELVIN
So long.
Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped.
Oh, hell... she missed him.
INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He
is impatient.
MELVIN
You going to come talk to me or
not?
SIMON
I'm coming.
We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be
allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.
SIMON
What did she say?
MELVIN
I'm a great guy --
""extraordinary""...
(before Simon can
celebrate)
... and she doesn't want contact
with me.
(a beat)
I'm dying here.
SIMON
Because...
(gently)
... you love her?
MELVIN
(sharply)
No... and you're supposed to be
sensitive and sharp.
SIMON
Okay... you tell me why --
(mimics him)
""You're dying here.""
MELVIN
I don't know... Let me sleep on it
and figure it out.
(then)
Because I'm stuck! Can't go back
to what I had... She's evicted me
from my life.
SIMON
Did you like it that much?
MELVIN
(furiously)
It was better than this... Look,
you, I'm very intelligent. If
you're going to give me advice or
conversation or consolation or
hope, you got to be better than
you're doing. If you can't be at
least momentarily interesting than
shut the hell up. I'm drowning
and you're describing water.
SIMON
(getting pissed)
Picking on me won't help.
MELVIN
Well, if that's true then I'm
really in trouble.
SIMON
But you know where you're lucky?
MELVIN
Absolutely not.
SIMON
You know who you want. I'll take
your seat any day. So do
something... don't sleep on it...
go over there. I don't think
anybody should ever sleep on
anything -- it's not always good
to let things calm down.
MELVIN
Hey... I'm charged here. But she
might kill me for showing up this
late.
SIMON
Then get in your jammies and I'll
read you a story... I think you've
got a chance. The only real enemy
you have is her ability to think
logically -- the best thing you
have going for you is your
willingness to humiliate yourself
if it gives you one chance in
whatever -- so go catch her off-
guard.
MELVIN
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.
SIMON
What's wrong?
MELVIN
I forgot to lock the door.
EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) -
NIGHT
As he parks. He exits the car -- now wary... looks at
his watch... hesitates... walks reluctantly into the
apartment house.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT
As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great
uncertainty.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting
directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading
one of Melvin's books...
There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL...
someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly
-- so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL --
until the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to
her wide open window and looks over.
HER POV
The convertible at the curb.
BACK TO SCENE
She hesitates --
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT
As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the
sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds.
He bolts for the door and enters.
INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN
SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.
CAROL
What do you want, Melvin?
MELVIN
Were you asleep?
CAROL
What do you want?
MELVIN
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm
sorry. And you could be grouchy.
CAROL
Grouchy?
MELVIN
... 'Cause of being woken up, and
it would make my job impossible.
So then I wouldn't even try.
CAROL
What job?
MELVIN
Were you asleep?
CAROL
What are you doing here?
ANOTHER ANGLE
Beverly in the hallway looking on --
BACK TO SCENE
MELVIN
I'm sorry I woke you -- some other
time.
He half turns to leave.
CAROL
I wasn't asleep!!
MELVIN
What a break...
CAROL
(losing it a bit)
Is it a secret what you're doing
here?
MELVIN
I had to see you...
CAROL
Because...
MELVIN
It relaxes me... I'd feel better
just sitting on the curb in front
of your house than anyplace else
I can think of or imagine.
Carol has not ever heard anything like that before...
it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her
door down the hallway, has heard at least this last
part...
Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone...
MELVIN
(serious)
Wait a minute, I'm overstating
here, maybe the inside stairs. I
don't want to sit with my feet in
the gutter. What does that serve?
It only...
But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.
CAROL
Stop it!! Why can't I have a
normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out
of here. Just a regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me...
BEVERLY
(butting in)
Everybody wants that, dear -- it
doesn't exit...
(as Carol turns
to her)
Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
She disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh --
gathers herself. A beat.
MELVIN
(hopefully)
Boyfriend?
CAROL
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin
everything by being you.
MELVIN
Maybe we could live without the
wise cracks.
She looks at him -- then:
CAROL
Maybe we could...
Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen
linoleum and stalls at the door.
MELVIN
It feels a little confined here.
Let's take a walk.
CAROL
See. It's four in the morning. A
walk sounds a little screwy to me,
if you don't mind.
MELVIN
If you need an excuse, there's a
bakery on the corner. There's a
shot it'll open soon -- that way
we're not screwy -- we're just
two people who like warm rolls.
CAROL
Okay.
EXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT
They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual
attention to where he steps.
CAROL'S POV
Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement --
it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids
stepping on the lines.
BACK TO SCENE
Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing
down. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious
-- his habits making him appear unworthy.
CAROL
(gently; almost
lovingly)
I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever
this is -- is not going to work.
ON MELVIN
He takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper
something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his
history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.
MELVIN
I'm feeling... I've been feeling
better.
CAROL
Melvin, even though it may seem
that way now -- you don't know me
all that well...
(as he scoffs)
I'm not the answer for you.
She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns
back to him.
MELVIN
Hey, I've got a great compliment
for you.
CAROL
You know what? I...
MELVIN
Just let me talk.
(gathers himself
with uncertainty,
then:)
I'm the only one on the face of
the earth who realizes that you're
the greatest woman on earth. I'm
the only one who appreciates how
amazing you are in every single
thing you do -- in every single
thought you have... in how you
are with Spencer -- Spence...
(he has reached
her)
... in how you say what you mean
and how you almost always mean
something that's all about being
straight and good...
ON CAROL
She stands on the precipice of being transported away
from the logic which has been her lifeline.
MELVIN
I think most people miss that
about you and I watch wondering
how they can watch you bring them
food and clear their dishes and
never get that they have just met
the greatest woman alive... And
the fact that I get it makes me
feel great... about me!
(a real question
filled with
concern for her)
You got a real good reason to walk
out on that?
That last question clearly a true question, not the least
rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:
CAROL
No! It's certainly not. No -- I
don't think so. No.
MELVIN
(tentatively)
I'm gonna grab you.
(with conviction)
I didn't mean it to be a question.
I'm gonna grab you.
He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate.
A tense beat. Then:
MELVIN
I know I can do better.
They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A
first-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot
land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his
knowledge. They break -- look at each other without a
notion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in
unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a
path that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the
bakery turn on as it opens for business.
CAROL
Warm rolls...
They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As
they enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to
clean the entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto
a crack, this time notices -- registers the momentous
fact and joins Carol inside as we:
FADE OUT

Screenplay
By
Ethan Coen & Joel Coen
FADE IN:
ON BARTON FINK
He is a bespectacled man in his thirties, hale but somewhat
bookish. He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater,
looking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a
performance.
In the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a
flat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a
thick rope that hangs from the ceiling.
The voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen
stage:
ACTOR
I'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for
good. I'm kissin' it all goodbye,
these four stinkin' walls, the six
flights up, the el that roars by at
three A.M. like a castiron wind.
Kiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury!
I'll miss 'em � like hell I will!
ACTRESS
Dreaming again!
ACTOR
Not this time, Lil! I'm awake now,
awake for the first time in years.
Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a
dream if you've lived with your eyes
closed. Well my eyes are open now! I
see that choir, and I know they're
dressed in rags! But we're part of
that choir, both of us � yeah, and
you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!
MAURY
The sun's coming up, kid. They'll be
hawking the fish down on Fulton
Street.
ACTOR
Let 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their
hearts out.
MAURY
That's it, kid. Take that ruined
choir. Make it sing!
ACTOR
So long, Maury.
MAURY
So long.
We hear a door open and close, then approaching footsteps. A
tall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up
valise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage:
MAURY
We'll hear from that kid. And I don't
mean a postcard.
The actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int
he shadows behind Barton.
An older man in work clothes � not wardrobe � passes in front
of Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of
the stage and cups his hands to his mouth.
OLDER MAN
FISH! FRESH FISH!
As the man walks back off the screen:
LILY
Let's spit on our hands and get to
work. It's late, Maury.
MAURY
Not any more Lil...
Barton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor:
MAURY
...It's early.
With this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the
rope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts
of ""Bravo!""
As the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat
muting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame
toward the stage.
The stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain
back up and unmuting the applause.
Barton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other
men, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage.
BARTON'S POV
Looking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as
the curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take
their bows and the cry of ""Author, Author"" goes up from the
crowd.
The actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings.
BARTON
He hesitates, unable to take it all in.
He is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed
gentlemen.
As he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening.
TRACKING SHOT
Pushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he
leads the way through the restaurant.
MAITRE 'D
Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink...
several members of your party have
already arrived...
REVERSE
Pulling Barton
FINK
Is Garland Stanford here?
MAITRE 'D
He called to say he'd be a few minutes
late... Ah, here we are...
TRACKING IN
Toward a large semi-circular booth. Three guests, two me and
a woman in evening wear, are rising and beaming at Barton. A
fat middle-aged man, one of the tuxedoed gentlemen we saw
backstage, is moving out to let Barton slide in.
MAN
Barton, Barton, so glad you could
make it. You know Richard St.
Claire...
Barton nods and looks at the woman.
MAN
...and Poppy Carnahan. We're drinking
champagne, dear boy, in honor of the
occasion. Have you seen the Herald?
Barton looks sullenly at his champagne glass as the fat man
fills it.
BARTON
Not yet.
MAN
Well, I don't want to embarrass you
but Caven could hardly contain
himself. But more important, Richard
and Poppy here loved the play.
POPPY
Loved it! What power!
RICHARD
Yeah, it was a corker.
BARTON
Thanks, Richard, but I know for a
fact the only fish you've ever seen
were tacked to a the wall of the
yacht club.
RICHARD
Ouch!
MAN
Bravo! Nevertheless, we were all
devastated.
POPPY
Weeping! Copius tears! What did the
Herald say?
MAN
I happen to have it with me.
BARTON
Please Derek �
POPPY
Do read it, do!
DEREK
""Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the
Common Man. The star of the Bare
Ruined Choirs was not seen on the
stage of the Belasco last night �
though the thespians involved all
acquitted themselves admirably. The
find of the evening was the author
of this drama about simple folk �
fish mongers, in fact � whose brute
struggle for existence cannot quite
quell their longing for something
higher. The playwright finds nobility
in the most squalid corners and poetry
in the most callused speech. A tough
new voice in the American theater
has arrived, and the owner of that
voice is named... Barton Fink.""
BARTON
They'll be wrapping fish in it in
the morning so I guess it's not a
total waste.
POPPY
Cynic!
DEREK
Well we can enjoy your success,
Barton, even if you can't.
BARTON
Don't get me wrong � I'm glad it'll
do well for you, Derek.
DEREK
Don't worry about me, dear boy � I
want you to celebrate.
BARTON
All right, but I can't start listening
to the critics, and I can't kid myself
about my own work. A writer writes
from his gut, and his gut tells him
what's good and what's... merely
adequate.
POPPY
Well I don't pretend to be a critic,
but Lord, I have a gut, and it tells
me it was simply marvelous.
RICHARD
And a charming gut it is.
POPPY
You dog!
RICHARD
(baying)
Aaa-woooooooo!
Barton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling.
We swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the
restaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with
Barton's name on it.
TRACKING IN TOWARD A BAR
A distinguished fifty-year-old gentleman in evening clothes
is nursing a martini, watching Barton approach.
PULLING BARTON
As he draws near.
BARTON
I thought you were going to join us.
Jesus, Garland, you left me alone
with those people.
GARLAND
Don't panic, I'll join you in a
minute. What's you think of Richard
and Poppy?
Barton scowls
BARTON
The play was marvelous. She wept,
copiously. Millions of dollars and
no sense.
Garland smiles, then draws Barton close.
GARLAND
We have to talk a little business.
I've just been on the phone to Los
Angeles. Barton, Capitol Pictures
wants to put you under contract.
They've offered you a thousand dollars
a week. I think I can get them to go
as high as two.
BARTON
To do what?
GARLAND
What do you do far a living?
BARTON
I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try
to make a difference.
GARLAND
Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton,
because I respect you, but let me
point out a couple of things. One,
here you make a difference to five
hundred fifty people a night � if
the show sells out. Eighty five
million people go to the pictures
every week.
BARTON
To see pap.
GARLAND
Yes, generally, to see pap. However,
point number two: A brief tenure in
Hollywood could support you through
the writing of any number of plays.
BARTON
I don't know, Garland; my place is
here right now. I feel I'm on the
brink of success-
GARLAND
I'd say you're already enjoying some.
Barton leans earnestly forward.
BARTON
No, Garland, don't you see? Not the
kind of success where the critics
fawn over you or the producers like
Derek make a lot of money. No, a
real success � the success we've
been dreaming about � the creation
of a new, living theater of, about,
and for the common man! If I ran off
to Hollywood now I'd be making money,
going to parties, meeting the big
shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself
off from the wellspring of that
success, from the common man.
He leans back and chuckles ruefully.
BARTON
...I guess I'm sprouting off again.
But I am certain of this, Garland:
I'm capable of more good work. Maybe
better work than I did in Choirs. It
just doesn't seem to me that Los
Angeles is the place to lead the
life of mind.
GARLAND
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm
just the ten percenter. You decide
what you want and I'll make it happen.
I'm only asking that your decision
be informed by a little realism � if
I can use that word and Hollywood in
the same breath.
Barton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the
floor.
Garland studies him.
GARLAND
...Look, they love you, kid �
everybody does. You see Caven's review
in the Herald?
BARTON
No, what did it say?
GARLAND
Take my copy. You're the toast of
Broadway and you have the opportunity
to redeem that for a little cash �
strike that, a lot of cash.
Garland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.
GARLAND
...The common man'll still be here
when you get back. What the hell,
they might even have one or two of
'em out in Hollywood.
Absently:
BARTON
...That's a rationalization, Garland.
Garland smiles gently.
GARLAND
Barton, it was a joke.
We hear a distant rumble. It builds slowly and we cut to:
A GREAT WAVE
Crushing against the Pacific shore.
The roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to:
HOTEL LOBBY
A high wide shot from the front door, looking down across
wilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty
wing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed.
Amber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from
behind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights.
Barton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops
in the middle foreground to look across the lobby.
We are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is
empty. There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in.
Barton moves toward the front desk.
THE REVERSE
As Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver
bell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without
losing volume.
After a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs.
Barton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at
the floor behind the front desk.
A TRAP DOOR
It swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform,
holding a shoebrush and a shoe � not one of his own � climbs
up from the basement.
He closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his
finger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting
it.
The lobby is now silent again.
CLERK
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I
help you, sir?
BARTON
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
The clerk flips through cards on the desk.
CLERK
F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be
you, huh?
BARTON
Must be.
CLERK
Okay then, everything seems to be in
order. Everything seems to be in
order.
He is turning to a register around for Barton to sign.
CLERK
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
BARTON
Excuse me?
CLERK
Transient or resident?
BARTON
I don't know... I mean, I'll be here,
uh, indefinitely.
CLERK
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a
week payable in advance. Checkout
time is twelve sharp, only you can
forget that on account you're a rez.
If you need anything, anything at
all, you dial zero on your personal
in-room telephone and talk to me. My
name is Chet.
BARTON
Well, I'm going to be working here,
mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do
you have room service?
CLERK
Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the
night clerk. I can always ring out
for sandwiches.
The clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index
card.
CLERK
...Though we provide privacy for the
residential guest, we are also a
full service hotel including
complimentary shoe shine. My name is
Chet.
He pushes a room key across the counter on top of the index
card.
Barton looks at the card.
On it: ""CHET!"" Barton looks back up at the clerk. They regard
each other for a beat.
CLERK
...Okay
BARTON
Huh?
The clerk.
CLERK
Okey-dokey, go ahead.
BARTON
What �
CLERK
Don't you wanna go to your room?!
Barton stares at him.
BARTON
...What number is it?
The clerk stares back.
CLERK
...Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell
you.
As Barton stoops to pick up his two small bags:
CLERK
...Those your only bags?
BARTON
The others are being sent.
The clerk leans over the desk to call after him:
CLERK
I'll keep an eye out for them. I'll
keep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.
Barton is walking to the elevator.
ELEVATOR
Barton enters and sets down his bags.
An aged man with white stubble, wearing a greasy maroon
uniform, sits on a stool facing the call panel. He does not
acknowledge Barton's presence.
After a beat:
BARTON
...Six, please.
The elevator man gets slowly to his feet. As he pushes the
door closed:
ELEVATOR MAN
Next stop: Six.
SIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY
Barton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the
doors.
The long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained
forest green carpet. The wallpaper shows faded yellowing
palm trees. Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door
midway down the hall.
HIS ROOM
As Barton enters.
The room is small and cheaply furnished. There is a lumpy
bed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and
a wooden luggage stand.
As Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and
wash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and
a window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft.
Barton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks,
jittering. He shrugs off his jacket.
Pips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow. The room is hot.
He walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and
struggles to throw open the window. After he strains at it
for a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound.
Barton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary
table. He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat.
Next to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary:
""THE HOTEL EARLE: A DAY OR A LIFETIME.""
We pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall
above the desk. A bathing beauty sits on the beach under a
cobalt blue sky. One hand shields her eyes from the sun as
she looks out at a crashing surf.
The sound of the surf mixes up.
BARTON
Looking at the picture
TRACKING IN ON THE PICTURE
The surf mixes up louder. We hear a gull cry.
The sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone.
THE HOUSE PHONE
On the nightstand next to the bed. With a groan of bedsprings
Barton sits into frame and picks up the telephone.
VOICE
How d'ya like your room!
BARTON
...Who is this?
VOICE
Chet!
BARTON
...Who?
VOICE
Chet! From downstairs!
Barton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose.
VOICE
...How d'ya like your room!
A PILLOW
As Barton's head drops down into frame against it.
He reaches over and turns off the bedside light.
He lies back and closes his eyes.
A long beat.
We hear a faint hum, growing louder.
Barton opens his eyes.
HIS POV
A naked, peeling ceiling. The hum � a mosquito, perhaps �
stops.
BARTON
His eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he
shuts them again.
After another silent beat, we hear � muffled, probably from
am adjacent room � a brief, dying laugh. It is sighing and
weary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob.
Silence again.
We hear the rising mosquito hum.
FADE OUT
EXECUTIVE OFFICE
Barton Fink is ushered into a large, light office by an
obsequious middle- aged man in a sagging suit.
There are mosquito bites on Barton's face.
REVERSE
From behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive
suit gets to his feet and strides across the room.
MAN
Is that him?! Barton Fink?! Lemme
put my arms around this guy!
He bear-hugs Barton.
MAN
...How the hell are ya? Good trip?
He separates without waiting for an answer.
MAN
My name is Jack Lipnik. I run this
dump. You know that � you read the
papers.
Lipnik is lumbering back to his desk.
MAN
Lou treating you all right? Got
everything you need? What the hell's
the matter with your face? What the
hell's the matter with his face,
Lou?
BARTON
It's not as bad as it looks; just a
mosquito in my room �
LIPNIK
Place okay?
To Lou:
LIPNIK
...Where did we put him?
BARTON
I'm at the Earle.
LIPNIK
Never heard of it. Let's move him to
the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell,
he can stay at my place.
BARTON
Thanks, but I wanted a place that
was less...
LIPNIK
Less Hollywood? Sure, say it, it's
not a dirty word. Sat whatever the
hell you want. The writer is king
here at Capitol Pictures. You don't
believe me, take a look at your
paycheck at the end of every week �
that's what we think of the writer.
(to Lou)
...so what kind of pictures does he
like?
LOU
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference,
Mr. Lipnik.
LIPNIK
How's about it, Bart?
BARTON
To be honest, I don't go to the
pictures much, Mr. Lipnik �
LIPNIK
That's okay, that's okay, that's
okay � that's just fine. You probably
just walked in here thinking that
was going to be a handicap, thinking
we wanted people who knew something
about the medium, maybe even thinking
there was all kind of technical mumbo-
jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong.
We're only interested in one thing:
Can you tell a story, Bart? Can you
make us laugh, can you make us cry,
can you make us wanna break out in
joyous song? Is that more than one
thing? Okay. The point is, I run
this dump and I don't know the
technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run
it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit.
Showmanship. And also, and I hope
Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner
than any other kike in this town.
Did you tell him that, Lou? And I
don't mean my dick's bigger than
yours, it's not a sexual thing �
although, you're the writer, you
would know more about that. Coffee?
BARTON
...Yes, thank you.
LIPNIK
Lou.
Lou immediately rises and leaves. Lipnik's tone becomes
confidential:
LIPNIK
...He used to have shares in the
company. An ownership interest. Got
bought out in the twenties � muscled
out according to some. Hell, according
to me. So we keep him around, he's
got a family. Poor schmuck. He's
sensitive, don't mention the old
days. Oh hell, say whatever you want.
Look, barring a preference, Bart,
we're gonna put you to work on a
wrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I
say this because they tell me you
know the poetry of the street. That
would rule out westerns, pirate
pictures, screwball, Bible, Roman...
He rises and starts pacing.
LIPNIK
But look, I'm not one of these guys
thinks poetic has gotta be fruity.
We're together on that, aren't we? I
mean I'm from New York myself � well,
Minsk if you wanna go way back, which
we won't if you don't mind and I
ain't askin'. Now people're gonna
tell you, wrestling. Wallace Beery,
it's a B picture. You tell them,
bullshit. We don't make B pictures
here at Capitol. Let's put a stop
to that rumor right now.
Lou enters with coffee.
LIPNIK
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us.
Talking about the Wallace Beery
picture.
LOU
Excellent picture.
LIPNIK
We got a treatment on it yet?
LOU
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the
story. Saturday Evening Post.
LIPNIK
Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace
Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know
his hopes, his dreams. Naturally,
he'll have to get mixed up with a
bad element. And a romantic interest.
You know the drill. Romantic
interest, or else a young kid. An
orphan. What do you think, Lou?
Wally a little too old for a romantic
interest? Look at me, a writer in
the room and I'm askin' Lou what the
goddamn story should be!
After a robust laugh, he beams at Barton.
LIPNIK
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan?
Dame?
BARTON
...Both maybe?
There is a disappointed silence. Lipnik looks at Lou. Lou
clears his throat.
LOU
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
LIPNIK
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at
it. He'll get into the swing of
things or I don't know writers. Let's
make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple.
We don't gotta tackle the world our
first time out. The important thing
is we all have that Barton Fink
feeling, but since you're Barton
Fink I'm assuming you have it in
spades. Seriously Bart, I like you.
We're off to a good start. Dammit,
if all our writers were like you I
wouldn't have to get so goddamn
involved. I'd like to see something
by the end of the week.
Lou is getting to his feet and signaling for Barton to do
likewise.
LIPNIK
...Heard about your show, by the
way. My man in New York saw it. Tells
me it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty
damn moving. A little fruity, he
said, but I guess you know what you're
doing. Thank you for your heart. We
need more heart in pictures. We're
all expecting great things.
TRACKING SHOT
We are in the sixth-floor hallway of the Earle, late at night.
A pair of shoes sits before each door. Faintly, from one of
the rooms, we can hear the clack. clack. clack. of a
typewriter.
It grows louder as we track forward.
EXTREME CLOSE SHOT � TYPEWRITER
Close on the typing so that we see only each letter as it is
typed, without context.
One by one the letters clack on: a-u-d-i-b-l-e. After a short
beat, a period strikes.
BARTON
Elbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just written.
He rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more.
THE PAGE
It says:
FADE IN:
A TENEMENT BUILDING
On Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is
audible.
BARTON
After a beat he rolls the sheet back into place.
EXTREME CLOSE SHOT
The letter-strike area. It is lined up to the last period,
which is struck over by a comma. The words ""as is"" are typed
in and we cut back to �
BARTON
� as he continues typing. He stops after several more
characters and looks.
Silence.
Breaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room.
A man's laughter. It is weary, solitary, mirthless.
Barton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.
HIS POV
The picture of the girl on the beach.
BARTON
Staring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues. Barton
looks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but
the sound is too insistent to ignore.
WIDE SHOT
The room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall.
The laughter.
Barton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and
looks out.
HIS POV
The empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the
end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the
staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of
wall sconces.
The laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the
empty hall.
Perhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because
it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for
weeping.
Barton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly
withdraws into his room.
HIS ROOM
Barton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The
laughter/weeping continues.
He walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house
phone.
BARTON
Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink
in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's
someone in the room next door to
mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh...
making a lot of... noise.
After a beat:
BARTON
...Thank you.
He cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment or
two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the
telephone ringing next door.
Barton looks at the wall.
The muffled sound of a man talking.
The sound of the earpiece being pronged.
Muffled footsteps next door.
The sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting.
Footsteps approaching the hall.
A hard, present knock at Barton's door.
Barton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door.
ON THE DOOR
As Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man � a
very large man � in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened
tie. His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of
sweat.
MAN
Did you... Somebody just complained...
Hastily:
BARTON
No, I didn't � I mean, I did call
down, not to complain exactly, I was
just concerned that you might � not
that it's my business, but that you
might be in some kind of... distress.
You see, I was trying to work, and
it's, well, it was difficult �
MAN
Yeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered
you. The damn walls here, well, I
just apologize like hell...
He sticks his hand out.
MAN
...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess
we're neighbors...
Without reaching for the hand.
BARTON
Barton Fink.
Unfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask.
CHARLIE
Neighbor, I'd feel better about the
damned inconvenience if you'd let me
buy you a drink.
BARTON
That's all right, really, thank you.
CHARLIE
All right, hell, you trying to work
and me carrying on in there. Look,
the liquor's good, wuddya say?
As he enters:
CHARLIE
... You got a glass? It's the least
I can do.
BARTON
Okay... a quick one, sure...
He gets two glasses from the wash basin. Charlie sits down
on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask.
CHARLIE
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell,
all the carryings-on next door.
BARTON
That's okay, I assure you. It's just
that I was trying to work �
CHARLIE
What kind of work do you do, Barton,
if you don't mind my asking?
BARTON
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
CHARLIE
You don't say. That's a tough racket.
My hat's off to anyone who can make
a go of it. Damned interesting work,
I'd imagine.
BARTON
Can be. Not easy, but �
CHARLIE
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
As he hands Charlie a glass:
BARTON
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
CHARLIE
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton,
you might say I sell peace of mind.
Insurance is my game � door-to-door,
human contact, still the only way to
move merchandise.
He fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty
glass.
CHARLIE
...In spite of what you might think
from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
BARTON
Doesn't surprise me at all.
CHARLIE
Hell yes. Because I believe in it.
Fire, theft, and casualty are not
things that only happen to other
people � that's what I tell 'em.
Writing doesn't work out, you might
want to look into it. Providing for
basic human need � a fella could do
worse.
BARTON
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
CHARLIE
What kind of scribbler are you �
newspaperman did you say?
BARTON
No, I'm actually writing for the
pictures now �
CHARLIE
Pictures! Jesus!
He guffaws.
CHARLIE
...I'm sorry, brother, I was just
sitting here thinking I was talking
to some ambitious youngster, eager
to make good. Hell, you've got it
made! Writing for pictures! Beating
out that competition! And me being
patronizing!
He gestures toward his face:
CHARLIE
...Is the egg showing or what?!
BARTON
That's okay; actually I am just
starting out in the movies � though
I was pretty well established in New
York, some renown there,
CHARLIE
Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm
not the best-read mug on the planet,
so I guess it's no surprise I didn't
recognize your name. Jesus, I feel
like a heel.
For the first time Barton smiles.
BARTON
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a
playwright. My shows've only played
New York. Last one got a hell of a
write-up in the Herald. I guess that's
why they wanted me here.
CHARLIE
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality.
What kind of venue, that is to say,
thematically, uh...
BARTON
What do I write about?
Charlie laughs.
CHARLIE
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah,
that's it, Bart.
BARTON
Well, that's a good question. Strange
as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I
write about people like you. The
average working stiff. The common
man.
CHARLIE
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
BARTON
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way,
that's exactly the point. There's a
few people in New York � hopefully
our numbers are growing � who feel
we have an opportunity now to forge
something real out of everyday
experience, create a theater for the
masses that's based on a few simple
truths � not on some shopworn
abstractions about drama that doesn't
hold true today, if they ever did...
He gazes at Charlie.
BARTON
...I don't guess this means much to
you.
CHARLIE
Hell, I could tell you some stories�
BARTON
And that's the point, that we all
have stories. The hopes and dreams
of the common man are as noble as
those of any king. It's the stuff of
life � why shouldn't it be the stuff
of theater? Goddamnit, why should
that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't
call it new theater, Charlie; call
it real theater. Call it our theater.
CHARLIE
I can see you feel pretty strongly
about it.
BARTON
Well, I don't mean to get up on my
high horse, but why shouldn't we
look at ourselves up there? Who
cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop
and Lady Higginbottom and � and �
and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
CHARLIE
I can feel my butt getting sore
already.
BARTON
Exactly, Charlie! You understand
what I'm saying � a lot more than
some of these literary types. Because
you're a real man!
CHARLIE
And I could tell you some stories �
BARTON
Sure you could! And yet many writers
do everything in their power to
insulate themselves from the common
man � from where they live, from
where they trade, from where they
fight and love and converse and �
and � and... so naturally their work
suffers, and regresses into empty
formalism and � well, I'm spouting
off again, but to put it in your
language, the theater becomes as
phony as a three dollar bill.
CHARLIE
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right
there.
BARTON
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Charlie laughs.
CHARLIE
Whatever that means.
Barton smiles with him.
BARTON
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad
you stopped by. I'm sorry if � well
I know I sometimes run on.
CHARLIE
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy,
I'll let you know if I'm bored. I
find it all pretty damned interesting.
I'm the kind schmoe who's generally
interested in the other guy's point
of view.
BARTON
Well, we've got something in common
then.
Charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door.
CHARLIE
Well Christ, if there's any way I
can contribute, or help, or whatever�
Barton chuckles and extends his hand.
BARTON
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by
just being yourself.
CHARLIE
Well, I can tell you some stories �
He pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway.
CHARLIE
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about
the interruption. Too much revelry
late at night, you forget there are
other people in the world.
BARTON
See you, Charlie.
Charlie closes the door and is gone.
Barton goes back to his desk and sits.
Muffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening
and closing.
Barton looks at the wall.
HIS POV
The bathing beauty.
From offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive-giving-way sound.
BARTON
He looks around to the opposite �
bed � wall.
HIS POV
The wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat.
One swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from
the wall. About three feet of the wall, where it meets the
ceiling, is exposed.
The strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and
nods above the bed. It glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical
flower.
BACK TO BARTON
He goes over to the bed and steps up onto it. He smooths the
wallpaper back up against the wall.
He looks at his hand.
HIS HAND
Sticky with tacky yellow wall sweat.
He wipes it onto his shirt.
We hear a faint mosquito hum.
Barton looks around.
FADE OUT
A TYPEWRITER Whirring at high speed. The keys strike too
quickly for us to make out the words.
SLOW TRACK IN
On Barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring
blankly. Distant phones ring. Barton's eyes are tired and
bloodshot.
HIS POV
A gargoyle secretary sits typing a document.
The office door opens in the background and a short middle-
aged man in a dark suit emerges.
To his secretary:
EXECUTIVE
I'm eating on the lot today �
He notices Barton.
EXECUTIVE
...Who's he?
The secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip
of paper on her desk.
SECRETARY
Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler.
GEISLER
More please.
BARTON
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum
said I should drop by morning to see
you about the �
GEISLER
Ever act?
BARTON
...Huh? No, I'm �
GEISLER
We need Indians for a Norman Steele
western.
BARTON
I'm a writer. Ted O �
GEISLER
Think about it, Fink. Writers come
and go; we always need Indians.
BARTON
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're
producing this Wallace Beery picture
I'm working on.
GEISLER
What!? Ted Okum doesn't know shit.
They've assigned me enough pictures
for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum
doesn't know you could almost squeeze
into the Hollywood Bowl.
BARTON
Then who should I talk to?
Geisler gives a hostile stare. Without looking at her, he
addresses the secretary:
GEISLER
Get me Lou Breeze.
He perches on the edge of the desk, an open hand out toward
the secretary, as he glares wordlessly at Barton.
After a moment:
SECRETARY
Is he in for Mr. Geisler?
She puts the phone in Geisler's hand.
GEISLER
Lou? How's Lipnik's ass smell this
morning?... Yeah?... Yeah?... Okay,
the reason I'm calling, I got a writer
here, Fink, all screwy. Says I'm
producing that Wallace Beery wrestling
picture � what'm I, the goddamn
janitor around here?... Yeah, well
who'd you get that from?... Yeah,
well tell Lipnik he can kiss my
dimpled ass... Shit! No, alright...
No, no, all right.
Without looking he reaches the phone back. The secretary
takes it and cradles it.
GEISLER
...Okay kid, let's chow.
COMMISSARY
Barton and Geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth. Geisler
speaks through a mouthful of food:
GEISLER
Don't worry about it. It's just a B
picture. I bring it in on budget,
they'll book it without even screening
it. Life is too short.
BARTON
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at
the script, see something by the end
of the week.
GEISLER
Sure he did. And he forgot about it
before your ass left his sofa.
BARTON
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting
started. It's funny, I'm blocked up.
I feel like I need some kind of
indication of... what's expected �
GEISLER
Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture.
What do you need, a road map?
Geisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at Barton.
GEISLER
...Look, you're confused? You need
guidance? Talk to another writer.
BARTON
Who?
Geisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate.
GEISLER
Jesus, throw a rock in here, you'll
hit one. And do me a favor, Fink:
Throw it hard.
COMMISSARY MEN'S ROOM
Barton stands at a urinal.
He stares at the wall in front of him as he pees. After a
moment, he cocks his head, listening.
We hear a throat clearing, as if by a tenor preparing for a
difficult passage. It is followed by the gurgling ruch of
vomit.
Barton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls.
There is more businesslike throat clearing.
Barton stoops.
HIS POV
We boom down to show the blue serge pants and well-polished
shoes of the stall's kneeling occupant.
A white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect
the trouser knees.
The toilet flushes. The man rises, picks up his handkerchief
up off the floor and gives it a smart flap.
BARTON
He quickly straightens and goes to the sink. He starts washing
his hands. We hear the stall door being unlatched.
Barton glances over his shoulder.
HIS POV
The stall door opening.
BARTON
Quickly, self-consciously, he looks back down at his hands.
HIS POV
His hands writhing under the running water. We hear footsteps
approaching.
BARTON
Forcing himself to look at his hands. We hear the man reach
the adjacent sink and turn on the tap.
Barton can't help glancing up.
THE MAN
A dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit. He has warm
brown eyes, a patrician nose, and a salt-and-pepper mustache.
He smiles pleasantly at Barton.
BARTON
He gives a nervous smile � more like a tic � and looks back
down at his hands. We hear the man gargling water and spitting
into the sink.
After a moment, Barton looks up again.
THE MAN
Reacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. This time,
a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile.
BARTON
Looks back down, then up again.
THE MAN
Extends a dripping hand.
MAN
Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.
His speech is softly accented, from the South.
BARTON
Barton Fink.
They shake, then return to their ablutions.
We hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned
off and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton's
eyes are widening.
BARTON
...Jesus. W.P.!
The dapper little man stops and turns.
MAYHEW
I beg your pardon?
BARTON
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
MAYHEW
Just Bill, please.
Barton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little
man, his hands dripping onto the floor. There is a short
pause. Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but
urgent.
BARTON
Bill!...
Mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Finally
Barton brings out:
BARTON
...You're the finest novelist of our
time.
Mayhew leans against a stall.
MAYHEW
Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein'
occupied here in the worship of
Mammon, I haven't had the chance yet
to see your play �
He smiles at Barton's surprise.
MAYHEW
...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the
news reaches us in Hollywood.
He is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid.
BARTON
Sir, I'm flattered that you even
recognize my name. My God, I had no
idea you were in Hollywood.
MAYHEW
All of us undomesticated writers
eventually make their way out here
to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's
why I allus have such a powerful
thrust.
He clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves
it at Barton.
MAYHEW
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh
Fink?
BARTON
It's still a little early for me.
MAYHEW
So be it.
He knocks back some more.
BARTON
...Bill, if I'm imposing you should
say so, I know you're very busy � I
just, uh... I just wonder if I could
ask you a favor... That is to say,
uh... have you ever written a
wrestling picture?
Mayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat.
MAYHEW
...You are drippin', suh.
Barton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown
paper towel from a dispenser.
Mayhew sighs:
MAYHEW
...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented
a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew
has not, at one time or othuh, been
invited to essay. I have taken my
stabs at the wrastlin' form, as I
have stabbed at so many others, and
with as little success. I gather
that you are a fresh-man here, eager
for an upperclassman's council.
However, just at the moment...
He waves his flask.
MAYHEW
...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't
you stop at my bungalow, which is
numbah fifteen, later on this
afternoon...
He turns to leave.
MAYHEW
...and we will discuss wrastlin'
scenarios and other things lit'rary.
THE NUMBER ""15""
We are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door.
Muted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice � enraged,
bellowing. We hear things breaking. Softer, we hear a woman's
voice, its tone placating.
REVERSE TRACKING SLOWLY IN
On Barton, standing in front of the door.
The noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice
again.
Barton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks.
With this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wailing
again.
The door cracks open.
The woman looks as if she has been crying.
WOMAN
...Can I help you?
BARTON
I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink...
Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this
afternoon. Is he in?
WOMAN
Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the
moment�
From inside, we hear Mayhew's wail.
MAYHEW
HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!
The woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps
outside, closing the door behind her.
WOMAN
Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr.
Mayhew's personal secretary. I know
this all must sound horrid. I really
do apologize...
Through the door Mayhew is still wailing piteously.
BARTON
Is, uh... Is he okay?
AUDREY
He will be... When he can't write,
he drinks.
MAYHEW
WHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S
M'HONEY!!
She brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes.
AUDREY
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
BARTON
How about you? Will you be alright?
AUDREY
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr
Fink?
BARTON
Yes I am. I'm working on a wres �
please call me Barton.
Audrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand.
AUDREY
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm
sure he'll want to reschedule your
appointment.
BARTON
Perhaps you and I could get together
at some point also. �I'm sorry if
that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't
know anyone here in this town.
Audrey smiles at him.
AUDREY
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
BARTON
Please, Barton.
AUDREY
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not
just Bill's secretary � Bill and I
are... I love. We-
MAYHEW'S VOICE
M'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!
Audrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes
and heavy footsteps.
BARTON
I see.
AUDREY
...I know this must look... funny.
BARTON
No, no �
Hurriedly:
AUDREY
We need each other. We give each
other... the things we need �
VOICE
M'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of
bitches... the water's lappin' up...
M'HONEY!!
AUDREY
I'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't
judge us. Please...
Flustered, she backs away and closes the door.
CLOSE ON A SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGE
Hand-printed on the package is the message:
""Hope these will turn the trick, Mr. Fink. � Chet!""
The wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened.
Two thumbtacks are taken out.
BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM
Late at night. The swath of wallpaper behind the bed has
sagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the
swath next to it.
Barton enters frame and steps up onto the bed.
He smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near
the top.
EXTREME CLOSE SHOT
On the tack. As Barton applies pressure to push it in, tacky
yellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around
the tack.
ON BARTON
Smoothing up the second swath.
As he pushes in the second tack he pauses, listening.
Muffled, through the wall, we can hear a woman moaning.
After a motionless beat, Barton eases his ear against the
wall.
CLOSE ON BARTON
As his ear meets the wall.
The woman's moaning continues. We hear the creaking of
bedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling.
Barton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the
secretary, where he sits. He stares at the paper in the
carriage.
HIS POV
The blank part of the page around the key-strike area, under
the metal prongs that hold the paper down.
We begin to hear moaning again.
BACK TO BARTON
Still looking; sweating.
HIS POV
Tracking in on the paper, losing the prongs from frame so
that we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the
page.
The moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks.
THE DOOR
As it swings open. Charlie Meadows leans in, smiling.
CHARLIE
Howdy, neighbor.
BARTON
Charlie. How are you.
CHARLIE
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting
you again. I heard you walking around
in here. Figured I'd drop by.
BARTON
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really
gotten started yet � what happened
to your ear?
� for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. As
he enters:
CHARLIE
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic
thing. Goes away for a while, but
it always comes back. Gotta put cotton
in it to staunch the flow of pus.
Don't worry, it's not contagious.
BARTON
Seen a doctor?
Charlie gives a dismissive wave.
CHARLIE
Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell
me? Can't trade my head in for a
new one.
BARTON
No, I guess you're stuck with the
one you've got. Have a seat.
Charlie perches on the corner of the bed.
CHARLIE
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my
place, but it's a goddamn mess. You
married, Bart?
BARTON
Nope.
CHARLIE
I myself have yet to be lassoed.
He takes his flask out.
CHARLIE
...Got a sweetheart?
BARTON
No... I guess it's something about
my work. I get so worked up over it,
I don't know; I don't really have a
lot of attention left over, so it
would be a little unfair...
CHARLIE
Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention.
In my experience, they pretend to
give it, but it's generally a smoke-
screen for demanding it back � with
interest. How about family, Bart?
How're you fixed in that department?
Barton smiles.
BARTON
My folks live in Brooklyn, with my
uncle.
CHARLIE
Mine have passed on. It's just the
three of us now...
He taps himself on the head, chuckling.
CHARLIE
...What's the expression � me myself
and I.
BARTON
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense,
we're all alone in this world aren't
we Charlie? I'm often surrounded by
family and friends, but...
He shrugs.
CHARLIE
Mm... You're no stranger to
loneliness, then. I guess I got no
beef; especially where the dames are
concerned. In my line of work I get
opportunities galore � always on the
wing, you know what I'm saying. I
could tell stories to curl your hair
� but it looks like you've already
heard 'em!
He laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pulls
a dog-eared photograph from his wallet. As he hands it to
Barton:
CHARLIE
...That's me in Kansas City, plying
my trade.
THE PHOTO
Charlie smiles and waves with one foot up on the running
board of a 1939 roadster. A battered leather briefcase dangles
from one hand.
CHARLIE
...It was taken by one of my policy
holders. They're more than just
customers to me, Barton. They really
appreciate what I have to offer them.
Ya see, her hubby was out of town at
the time �
BARTON
You know, in a way, I envy you
Charlie. Your daily routine � you
know what's expected. You know the
drill. My job is to plumb the depths,
so to speak, dredge something up
from inside, something honest. There's
no road map for that territory...
He looks from Charlie to the Underwood.
BARTON
...and exploring it can be painful.
The kind of pain most people don't
know anything about.
He looks back at Charlie.
BARTON
...This must be boring you.
CHARLIE
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
BARTON
Yeah...
He gives a sad chuckle.
BARTON
...Probably sounds a little grand
coming from someone who's writing a
wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
CHARLIE
Beery! You got no beef there! He's
good. Hell of an actor � though,
for my money, you can't beat Jack
Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff,
funny stuff. But don't get me wrong
� Beery, a wrestling picture, that
could be a pip. Wrestled some myself
back in school. I guess you know the
basic moves.
BARTON
Nope, never watched any. I'm not
that interested in the act itself �
CHARLIE
Okay, but hell, you should know what
it is. I can show you in about thirty
seconds.
He is getting down on his hands and knees.
CHARLIE
...You're a little out of your weight
class, but just for purposes of
demonstration �
BARTON
That's all right, really �
CHARLIE
Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest
thing in the world! You just get
down on your knees to my left, slap
your right hand here...
He indicated his own right bicep.
CHARLIE
...and your left hand here.
He indicated his left bicep.
Barton hesitates.
CHARLIE
...You can do it, champ!
Barton complies.
CHARLIE
...All right now, when I say ""Ready...
wrestle!"" you try and pin me, and I
try and pin you. That's the whole
game. Got it?
BARTON
...Yeah, okay.
CHARLIE
Ready... wrestle!
With one clean move Charlie flips Barton onto his back, his
head and shoulders hitting with a thump. Charlie pins Barton's
shoulders with his own upper body.
But before the move even seems completed Charlie is standing
again, offering his hand down to Barton.
CHARLIE
Damn, there I go again. We're gonna
wake the downstairs neighbors. I
didn't hurt ya, did I?
Barton seems dazed, but not put out.
BARTON
It's okay, it's okay.
CHARLIE
Well, that's all that wrestling is.
Except usually there's more grunting
and squirming before the pin. Well,
it's your first time. And you're out
of your weight class.
Barton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging the
back of his head. This registers on Charlie.
CHARLIE
...Jesus, I did hurt you!
He clomps hurriedly away.
CHARLIE
...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I
sure do apologize.
We hear water running, and Charlie reenters with a wet towel.
Barton accepts the towel and presses it to his head.
CHARLIE
...You sure you're okay?
Barton gets to his feet.
BARTON
I'm fine, Charlie. Really I am.
Actually, it's been helpful, but I
guess I should get back to work.
Charlie looks at him with some concern, then turns and heads
for the door.
CHARLIE
Well, it wasn't fair of me to do
that. I'm pretty well endowed
physically.
He opens the door.
CHARLIE
...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't
be much of a match for you at mental
gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you
need anything.
The door closes.
Barton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing the
back of his head. He rolls up the carriage and looks at the
page in the typewriter.
HIS POV
The page.
FADE IN:
A TENEMENT BUILDING
On Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is
audible, as is the cry fishmongers.
BACK TO BARTON
He rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the
page.
His gaze drifts up.
HIS POV
The bathing beauty.
BARTON
Looking at the picture. He presses the heels of his hands
against his ears.
HIS POV
The bathing beauty. Faint, but building, is the sound of the
surf.
BARTON
Head cocked. The surf is mixing into another liquid sound.
Barton looks sharply around.
THE BATHROOM
Barton enters.
The sink, which Charlie apparently left running when he wet
Barton's towel, is overflowing. Water spills onto the tile
floor.
Barton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and
reaches into the sink.
As his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged
sink gulp water.
BARTON'S HAND
Holding a dripping wad of cotton.
BARTON
After a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton
came from � and convulsively flips it away.
FADE OUT
FADE IN:
ON THE TITLE PAGE OF A BOOK:
""NEBUCHADNEZZAR
BY
W.P. Mayhew""
A hand enters with pen to inscribe: ""To Barton �
May this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn
among the Philistines. � Bill""
The book is closed and picked up.
WIDER
As-thoomp!-the heavy volume is deposited across the table,
in front of Barton, by Mayhew.
Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are seated around a picnic table.
It is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco
open-air hamburger stand.
It is peaceful early evening. The last of the sunlight slopes
down through palm trees. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are the
only customers at the stand.
Mayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot.
Mayhew leans back in his chair.
MAYHEW
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell
the live oak.
AUDREY
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
MAYHEW
Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish
on me � lyin' and deceitful...
His eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the
breeze.
MAYHEW
...Still, I must say. I haven't felt
peace like this since the grand
productive days. Don't you find it
so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?
BARTON
Well... actually, no Bill...
Barton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing.
BARTON
...No, I've always found that writing
comes from a great inner pain. Maybe
it's a pain that comes from a
realization that one must do something
for one's fellow man � to help somehow
to ease his suffering. Maybe it's a
personal pain. At any rate, I don't
believe good work is possible without
it.
MAYHEW
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn'
things up. Yessir. Escape... It's
when I can't write, can't escape
m'self, that I want to tear m'head
off and run screamin' down the street
with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail.
Mm...
He sighs and reaches for a bottle of Wild Turkey.
MAYHEW
...This'll sometimes help.
AUDREY
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
BARTON
That's true, Bill. I've never found
it to help my writing.
Mayhew is becoming testy:
MAYHEW
Your writing? Son, have you ever
heard the story of Soloman's mammy-
Audrey, anticipating, jumps hastily in. She taps the book on
the table.
AUDREY
You should read this, Barton. I think
it's Bill's finest, or among his
finest anyway.
Mayhew looks at her narrowly.
MAYHEW
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like
an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly
scratched.
AUDREY
Bill �
BARTON
Look, maybe it's none of my business,
but a man with your talent � don't
you think your first obligation would
be to your gift? Shouldn't you be
doing whatever you have to do to
work again?
MAYHEW
And what would that be, son?
BARTON
I don't know exactly. But I do know
what you're doing with that drink.
You're cutting yourself off from
your gift, and from me and Audrey,
and from your fellow man, and from
everything your art is about.
MAYHEW
No son, thisahere moonshine's got
nothin' to do with shuttin' folks
out. No, I'm usin' it to build
somethin'.
BARTON
What's that?
MAYHEW
I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp,
brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee
to keep that ragin' river of manure
from lappin' at m'door.
AUDREY
Maybe you better too, Barton. Before
you get buried under his manure.
Mayhew chuckles.
MAYHEW
M'honey pretends to be impatient
with me, Barton, but she'll put up
with anything.
AUDREY
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
BARTON
You're lucky she puts up with as
much as she does.
Mayhew is getting to his feet.
MAYHEW
Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye.
People who know about the human heart,
though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over
here, he gives his honey love, and
she pays him back with pity � the
basest coin there is.
AUDREY
Stop it, Bill!
He wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees,
still clutching his bottle, his back to Barton and Audrey,
and urinates into the grass.
He is singing � loudly � ""Old Black Joe.""
Audrey walks over to him.
BARTON
Watching her go.
HIS POV
Audrey touches Mayhew's elbow. He looks at her, stops singing,
she murmurs something, and he bellows:
MAYHEW
The truth, m'honey, is a tart that
does not bear scrutiny.
She touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her,
knocking her to the ground.
MAYHEW
Breach my levee at your peril!
BARTON
He rises.
AUDREY
Coming back to Barton.
MAYHEW
Stumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and
waving his bottle of Wild Turkey.
AUDREY
Let him go.
BARTON
That son of a bitch... Don't get me
wrong, he's a fine writer.
He looks down the road. Mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving
in the dust.
MAYHEW
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific,
and from there I'll... improvise.
BARTON
Are you all right?
We hear distant bellowing:
MAYHEW
Silent upon a hill in Darien!
Audrey bursts into tears. Barton puts his arms around her
and she leans into him.
BARTON
Audrey, you can't put up with this.
Gradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears.
AUDREY
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for
him!
BARTON
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
AUDREY
No, sometimes he just... well, he
thinks about Estelle. His wife still
lives in Fayettesville. She's...
disturbed.
BARTON
Really?...
He considers this for a moment, but his anger returns.
BARTON
...Well that doesn't excuse his
behavior.
AUDREY
He'll wander back when he's sober
and apologize. He always does.
BARTON
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his �
AUDREY
Barton. Empathy requires...
understanding.
BARTON
What. What don't I understand?
Audrey gazes at him.
MAYHEW
He is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his
light summer suit. ""Old Black Joe"" floats back to us in the
twilight.
FADE OUT
BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM
From a high angle, booming down on Barton.
The room is dark. Barton lies fully clothed, stretched out
on the bed, asleep. The hum of the mosquito fades up in the
stillness.
Suddenly Barton slaps his cheek. His eyes open, but he remains
still. The hum fades up again. Barton reaches over and turns
on the bedside lamp. His eyes shift this way and that as he
waits, listening.
The hum fades down to silence.
Barton's eyes shift.
HIS POV
The typewriter sits on the secretary, a piece of paper rolled
halfway through the carriage.
THE TYPEWRITER
Barton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter.
HIS POV
Next to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper.
The page in the carriage reads:
FADE IN:
A TENEMENT HOTEL
On the Lower East Side. We can faintly hear the cry of the
fishmongers. It is too early for us to hear traffic; later,
perhaps, we will.
BACK TO BARTON
Looking down at the page.
CLOSE ON BARTON'S FEET
Swinging in the legwell.
One foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined
shoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the
legwell.
We hear typing start.
THE PAGE
A new paragraph being started: ""A large man...""
BARTON'S FEET
As he slides them into the shoes.
THE PAGE
""A large man in tights...""
The typing stops.
BARTON
Looking quizzically at the page. What's wrong?
HIS FEET
Sliding back and forth � swimming � in his shoes, which are
several sizes too large.
We hear a knock at the door.
BARTON
He rises and answers the door.
Charlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of
nicely shined shoes.
CHARLIE
I hope these are your shoes.
BARTON
Hi, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Because that would mean they gave
you mine.
BARTON
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did.
Come on in.
The two stocking-footed men go into the room and Barton
reaches under the secretary for Charlie's shoes.
CHARLIE
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had
one of those days?
BARTON
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Chalrie perches on the edge of the bed.
CHARLIE
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I
couldn't've sold ice water in the
Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't
want insurance, so okay, that's your
loss. But God, people can be rude.
Feel like I have to talk to a normal
person like just to restore a little
of my...
BARTON
Well, my pleasure. I could use a
little lift myself.
CHARLIE
A little lift, yeah...
Smiling, he takes out his flask.
CHARLIE
...Good thing they bottle it, huh
pal?
He takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours Barton a
shot:
CHARLIE
...Did I say rude? People can be
goddamn cruel. Especially some of
their housewives. Okay, so I've got
a weight problem. That's my cross to
bear. I dunno...
BARTON
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
CHARLIE
Defense against what? Insurance?
Something they need? Something they
should be thanking me for offering?
A little peace of mind?...
He shakes his head.
CHARLIE
...Finally decided to knock off early,
take your advice. Went to see a doctor
about this.
He indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton.
CHARLIE
...He told me it was an ear infection.
Ten dollars, please. I said, hell, I
told YOU my ear was infected. Why
don't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well,
THAT led to an argument...
He gives a rueful chuckle.
CHARLIE
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if
my problems amounted to a hill of
beans. How goes the life of the mind?
BARTON
Well, it's been better. I can't seem
to get going on this thing. That one
idea, the one that lets you get
started � I still haven't gotten it.
Maybe I only had one idea in me � my
play. Maybe once that was done, I
was done being a writer. Christ, I
feel like a fraud, sitting here
staring at this paper.
CHARLIE
Those two love-birds next door drivin'
you nuts?
Barton looks at him curiously.
BARTON
How did you know about that?
CHARLIE
Know about it? I can practically see
how they're doin' it. Brother, I
wish I had a piece of that.
BARTON
Yeah, but �
CHARLIE
Seems like I hear everything that
goes on in this dump. Pipes or
somethin'. I'm just glad I don't
have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee
hours.
He laughs.
CHARLIE
...Ah, you'll lick this picture
business, believe me. You've got a
head on your shoulders. What is it
they say? Where there's a head,
there's a hope?
BARTON
Where there's life there's hope.
Charlie laughs.
CHARLIE
That proves you really are a writer!
Barton smiles.
BARTON
And there's hope for you too, Charlie.
Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen
policies.
CHARLIE
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I
gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
BARTON
You're leaving?
CHARLIE
In a few days. Out to your stompin'
grounds as a matter of fact � New
York City. Things have gotten all
balled up at the Head Office.
BARTON
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.
I'll miss you.
CHARLIE
Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long
face! This is still home for me � I
keep my room, and I'll be back sooner
or later...
Barton rises and walks over to his writing table.
CHARLIE
...And � mark my words � by the time
I get back you're picture'll be
finished. I know it.
Barton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie.
BARTON
New York can be pretty cruel to
strangers, Charlie. If you need a
home-cooked meal you just look up
Morris and Lillian Fink. They live
on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.
We hear a tacky, tearing sound.
Barton looks toward the door.
Charlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton
sits.
The two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau � the
slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a
hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close
together.
THEIR POV
A swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from
the wall. It sags and nods.
CHARLIE
(off)
Christ!
THE TWO MEN
Frozen, looking.
CHARLIE
...Your room does that too?
BARTON
I guess the heat's sweating off the
wallpaper.
CHARLIE
What a dump...
He heads for the door and Barton follows.
CHARLIE
...I guess it seems pathetic to a
guy like you.
BARTON
Well...
CHARLIE
Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean
to a guy from New York.
BARTON
What do you mean?
CHARLIE
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
BARTON
Well, I guess you pick your poison.
CHARLIE
So they say.
BARTON
Don't pick up and leave without saying
goodbye.
CHARLIE
Course not, compadre. You'll see me
again.
Barton closes the door.
He goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter.
After a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the
ceiling.
We hear a loud thump.
HIS POV
The ceiling � a white, seamless space.
As we track in the thumping continues � slowly, rhythmically,
progressively louder � the effect, it seems, of odd doings
upstairs.
LOOKING DOWN ON BARTON
From a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the
ceiling.
We track slowly down toward him. The thumping continues,
growing louder, sharper.
HIS POV
Moving in on the ceiling. We close in on an unblemished area
and cease to have any sense of movement.
With a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame
to land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is
gone, having left a huge black ""T"" stamped into the white
ceiling.
We are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of
the key-strike area on a typewriter. More letters appear
rapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. The
thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter.
BEN GEISLER
Is emerging from his office. As he enters the secretary
stops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs
tonelessly, without looking up:
SECRETARY
Barton Fink.
GEISLER
Yeah. Fink. Come in.
The clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises.
GEISLER'S OFFICE
The two men enter.
This office is considerably smaller than Lipnik's, done in
grays and black. There are pictures on the wall of Geisler
with various celebrities.
Geisler sits behind his desk.
GEISLER
Wuddya got for me � what the hell
happened to your face?
BARTON
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
GEISLER
Like hell it is; there are no
mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos
breed in swamps � this is a desert
town. Wuddya got for me?
BARTON
Well I...
GEISLER
On the Beery picture! Where are we?
Wuddya got?
BARTON
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm
having some trouble getting started�
GEISLER
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus!
Started?! You mean you don't have
ANYthing?!
BARTON
Well not much.
Geisler leaps to his feet and paces.
GEISLER
What do you think this is? HAMLET?
GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED
GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big
men in tights! You know the drill!
BARTON
I'm afraid I don't really understand
that genre. maybe that's the prob-
GEISLER
Understand shit! I though you were
gonna consult another writer on this!
BARTON
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
GEISLER
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a
souse!
BARTON
He's a great writer �
GEISLER
A souse!
BARTON
You don't understand. He's in pain,
because he can't write-
GEISLER
Souse! Souse! He manages to write
his name on the back of his paycheck
every week!
BARTON
But... I thought no one cared about
this picture.
GEISLER
You thought! Where'd you get THAT
from? You thought! I don't know
what the hell you said to Lipnik,
but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You
understand that, Fink? He LIKES you!
He's taken an interest. NEVER make
Lipnik like you. NEVER!
Some puzzlement shows through Barton's weariness.
BARTON
I don't understand-
GEISLER
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's
taken an interest! What the hell did
you say to him?
BARTON
I didn't say anything-
GEISLER
Well he's taken an interest! That
means he'll make your life hell,
which I could care less about, but
since I drew the short straw to
supervise this turkey, he's gonna be
all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch
called me yesterday to ask how it's
going � don't worry, I covered for
you. Told him you were making progress
and we were all very excited. I told
him it was great, so now MY ass is
on the line. He wants you to tell
him all about it tomorrow.
BARTON
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
GEISLER
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't
read. You gotta TELL it to him-tell
him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
BARTON
Well what do I tell him?
Geisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then picks
up a telephone.
GEISLER
Projection...
As he waits, Geisler gives Barton a withering stare. It
continues throughout the phone conversation.
GEISLER
... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of
the screening rooms free this
afternoon?... Good, book it for me.
A writer named Fink is gonna come in
and you're gonna show him wrestling
pictures... I don't give a shit which
ones! WRESTLING pictures! Wait a
minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg
shooting one now?... Show him some
of the dailies on that.
He slams down the phone.
GEISLER
...This ought to give you some ideas.
He jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Barton.
GEISLER
...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at
Lipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes.
Don't cross me, Fink.
SCREEN
Black-and-white footage. A middle-aged man with a clapstick
enters and shouts:
CLAPPER
DEVIL ON THE CANVAS, twelve baker
take one.
Clap! The clapper withdraws. The angle is on a corner of the
ring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a
huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real
athlete. His hair is plastered against his bullet skull and
he has a small mustache.
VOICE
Action.
The wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center
ring and the camera. He affects a German accent:
WRESTLER
I will destroy him!
He passes the camera.
VOICE
Cut.
Flash frames.
The clapper enters again.
CLAPPER
Twelve baker take two.
Clap! He exits.
The wrestler moves toward the camera.
WRESTLER
I will destroy him!
VOICE
Cut.
The clapper enters
CLAPPER
Twelve baker take three.
Clap!
WRESTLER
I will destroy him!
SLOW TRACK IN ON BARTON
Seated alone in a dark screening room, the shaft of the
projection beam flickering over his left shoulder.
As we creep in closer:
WRESTLER
(off)
I will destroy him!... I will destroy
him!... I will destroy him!... I
will destroy him!...
Another off-microphone, distant voice from the screen:
VOICE
Okay, take five...
THE SCREEN
A jerky pan, interrupted by flash frames. The wrestler is
standing in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down
his face as he smokes a cigarette.
A cut in the film and another clapstick enters.
CLAPPER
Twelve charlie take one-
ON THE CLAP:
BACK TO BARTON
Staring at the screen, dull, wan, and forlorn.
VOICE
(off)
Action.
THE SCREEN
The angle is low � canvas level. We hold for a brief moment
on the empty canvas before two wrestlers crash down into
frame.
The German is underneath, on his back, pinned by the other
man.
The referee enters, cropped at the knees, and throws counting
fingers down into frame.
REFEREE
One... two...
WRESTLER
AAAAHHHH!!
The German bucks and throws his opponent out of frame.
VOICE
Cut.
CLAPPER
Twelve charlie take two.
Crash.
REFEREE
One... two...
WRESTLER
AAAAHHHH!!
BARTON
Glazed.
WRESTLER
(off)
AAAAAAHHHHHH!!... AAAAAAHHHHHH!!...
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!...
PAGE IN TYPEWRITER
The screaming drops out abruptly at cut. We hear only the
sound of heavy footfalls on carpet.
Below the opening paragraph, two new words have been added
to the typescript:
""Orphan?""
""Dame?""
The foot falls continue.
THE HOTEL ROOM
Night. Barton paces frantically back and forth.
He looks at his watch.
HIS POV
It is 12:30.
CLOSE ON THE PHONE
It is lifted out of the cradle.
BARTON
Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in
605. Can you try a number for me in
Hollywood... Slausen 6-4304.
We pull back to frame in Barton as we hear his call ring
through. Barton sweats.
BARTON
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
AUDREY
Hello.
BARTON
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know
it's late and I shouldn't be calling
you like this � believe me I wouldn't
have if I could see any other
alternative, but I � I'm sorry -
listen, how are you � I'm sorry. You
doing okay?
AUDREY
...Who is this?
BARTON
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
Through the phone, in the background, we hear Mayhew's drunken
bellowing.
MAYHEW
Sons of bitches! Drown 'em all!
We hear various objects dropping or being thrown to the floor.
AUDREY
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good
time-
MAYHEW
Drown all those rascals...
BARTON
I'm sorry, I just feel like �I know
I shouldn't ask, I just need some
kind of help, I just, I have a
deadline tomorrow-
MAYHEW
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
There is more clatter.
Audrey's voice is hushed, close to the phone:
AUDREY
All right Barton, I'll see if I can
slip away-
MAYHEW
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come
into the house... sons of bitches...
BARTON
If you could, I'd �
AUDREY
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
MAYHEW
Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!
BARTON
I need help, Audrey.
AUDREY
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets
down, passes out... I'm afraid he
thinks � well, he said you were a
buffoon, Barton. He becomes
irrational�
MAYHEW
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM!
DROWN 'EM! DROWN �
WIDE ON THE ROOM
Later. It is quiet. We are craning down toward the bed, where
Barton lies stretched out, his head buried beneath a pillow
as if to blot out the world.
The track reveals the wristwatch on Barton's dangled arm:
1:30.
THE HALLWAY
At the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on
over the elevator, with a faint bell.
BACK TO BARTON
With two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow
off his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his
watch.
There is a knock at the door.
Barton swings his feet off the bed.
THE DOORWAY
Barton opens the door to Audrey.
AUDREY
Hello, Barton.
BARTON
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank
you. I'm sorry to be such a... such
a... Thank you.
They enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edge
of the bed.
AUDREY
Now that's all right, Barton.
Everything'll be all right.
BARTON
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
AUDREY
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll
sleep for a while now. What is it
you have to do, exactly?
Barton paces.
BARTON
Well I have to come up with � an
outline, I'd guess you call it. The
story. The whole goddamn story. Soup
to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
AUDREY
It's alright, Barton. You don't have
to write actual scenes?
BARTON
No, but the whole goddamn � Audrey?
Have you ever had to read any of
Bill's wrestling scenarios?
Audrey laughs.
AUDREY
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
BARTON
What are they like? What are they
about?
AUDREY
Well, usually, they're... simply
morality tales. There's a good
wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he
confronts at the end. In between,
the good wrestler has a love interest
or a child he has to protect. Bill
would usually make the good wrestler
a backwoods type, or a convict. And
sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd
have the wrestler protecting an idiot
manchild. The studio always hated
that. Oh, some of the scripts were
so... spirited!
She laughs � then stops, realizing that she has laughed. She
looks at Barton.
AUDREY
...Barton.
She shakes her head.
AUDREY
...Look, it's really just a formula.
You don't have to type your soul
into it. We'll invent some names
and a new setting. I'll help you
and it won't take any time at all. I
did it for Bill so many times �
Barton's pacing comes up short.
BARTON
Did what for Bill?
Guardedly:
AUDREY
Well... THIS.
BARTON
You wrote his scripts for him?
AUDREY
Well, the basic ideas were frequently
his-
BARTON
You wrote Bill's scripts! Jesus
Christ, you wrote his � what about
before that?
AUDREY
Before what?
BARTON
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Audrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path.
AUDREY
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so
to speak-
BARTON
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey,
how long have you been his...
secretary?
AUDREY
Barton, I think we should concentrate
on OUR little project-
BARTON
I want to know how many of Bill's
books you wrote!
AUDREY
Barton!
BARTON
I want to know!
AUDREY
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
BARTON
Hah!
AUDREY
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL,
really, when he'd been drinking-
BARTON
I'll bet. Jesus � ""The grand
productive days."" What a goddamn
phony.
He resumes pacing.
BARTON
...W.P. Mayhew. William Goddamn
Phony Mayhew. All his guff about
escape. Hah! I'LL say he escaped!
Barton sighs and looks at his watch.
BARTON
...Well, we don't have much time.
He sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle.
AUDREY
It'll be fine... Don't judge him,
Barton. Don't condescend to him...
She strokes Barton's hair.
AUDREY
...It's not as simple as you think.
I helped Bill most by appreciating
him, by understanding him. We all
need understanding, Barton. Even
you, tonight, it's all you really
need...
She kisses him.
As Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away.
We frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward
the sink. We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and
Barton's breath, becoming labored.
The continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the
sink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the
porcelain white. We track up to the drain and are enveloped
by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of
pipes.
BLACK
FADE IN:
BARTON
The hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are
looking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn.
Barton's eyes snap open.
HIS POV
The white ceiling. A humming black speck flits across the
white.
BARTON
Slowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look following
the sound of the mosquito.
His gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the
hum stops.
HIS POV
Audrey lies facing away on her side of the bed, half covered
by a blanket.
BARTON
Gingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audrey's
back.
HIS POV
The alabaster white of Audrey's back.
The mosquito is feeding on it.
EXTREME CLOSE ON BARTON'S EYES
Looking.
EXTREME CLOSE ON THE MOSQUITO
Swelling with blood.
WIDER
As Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's back.
She doesn't react.
Barton draws his hand away. Audrey's back is smeared with
blood.
ON BARTON
He looks at his hand.
HIS POV
His hand is dripping with blood. Too much blood.
BACK TO BARTON
Eyes wide, he looks down at the bed.
HIS POV
Blood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of Audrey's
back.
BARTON
He pulls Audrey's shoulder.
AUDREY
She rolls onto her back. Her eyes are wide and lifeless.
Her stomach is nothing but blood. The top sheet, drawn to
her waist is drenched red and clings to her body.
BARTON
He screams.
He screams again.
We hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening
and closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door.
Barton's head spins towards the door. He is momentarily
frozen.
Another knock.
Barton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door.
THE DOORWAY
Over Barton's shoulder as he cracks the door.
Charlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a
sleeveless tee.
CHARLIE
Are you all right?
Barton stares dumbly for a moment.
CHARLIE
...Can I come in?
BARTON
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
CHARLIE
Are you sure �
BARTON
No... no...
Barton is nodding as he shuts the door in Charlie's face.
He walks back into the room.
HIS POV
Audrey's corpse, in long shot, face up on the bed.
BARTON
He walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and
starts back toward the door.
He stops short and turns back again to the room. He averts
his eyes � as it happens, toward the secretary.
He walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey.
CLOSE ON BARTON
As he sits in. He stares emptily down at the desk, in shock,
totally shut down. Behind him, we can see Audrey on the bed.
He stares for a long beat.
Strange, involuntary noises come from his throat. He is not
in control.
Becoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops.
He lurches to his feet.
THE DOORWAY
As Barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out.
HALLWAY
Barton peers out the see if the coast is clear.
HIS POV
The long hallway.
In the deep background, Chet, the night clerk, is stooping
in front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes. Next to him
is a castored shoe caddy.
All of the doorways between us and Chet are empty of shoes.
CHET
Close on him as, mid-stoop, he looks up.
CHET'S POV
Up the long hall. In the deep background a door is closing.
CHET
He pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the
shoe caddy. It squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall.
BARTON'S ROOM
Barton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak.
Eventually it becomes inaudible.
He cracks the door again, looks out, and exits.
HALLWAY
Barton goes to Charlie's room and knocks.
Footfalls end as the door is cracked open.
CHARLIE
Barton. Are you all right?
BARTON
No... Can I come in?
CHARLIE
Why don't we go to your room-
BARTON
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta
help me.
Once again he is breathing hard.
Charlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind
him.
CHARLIE
Get a grip on yourself, brother.
Whatever the problem is, we'll sort
it out.
BARTON
Charlie, I'm in trouble � something
horrible's happened � I've gotta
call the police...
Charlie leads him towards his room.
BARTON
...Will you stay with me till they
get here?
CHARLIE
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can
sort it-
He is pushing Barton's door open, but Barton grabs an elbow
to stop him.
BARTON
Before you go in � I didn't do this.
I don't know how it happened, but I
didn't... I want you to know that...
Charlie looks into his eyes. For a moment the two men stare
at each other � Charlie's look inquisitive, Barton's
supplicating.
Finally, Charlie nods.
CHARLIE
Okay.
He turns and pushes open the door.
BARTON'S ROOM
The two men enter.
Barton lingers by the door. Charlie walks into the foreground
to look off toward the bed.
His eyes widen and he screams.
He turns and disappears into the bathroom. We hear vomiting,
then the flush of a toilet.
CHARLIE
Jesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy...
His reaction has not encouraged Barton, who is more and more
agitated.
Charlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating.
CHARLIE
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is
this? What're we gonna do?
BARTON
I've gotta call the police � or you
could call for me �
CHARLIE
Hold on �
BARTON
You gotta believe me �
CHARLIE
Hold on �
BARTON
I didn't do this, I did NOT do this�
CHARLIE
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath.
Tell me what happened.
BARTON
I don't know! I woke up, she was...
God, you gotta believe me!
Charlie, in spite of himself, is sneaking horrified glances
back into the room.
CHARLIE
I believe you, brother, but this
don't look good.
BARTON
We gotta call the police �
CHARLIE
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
BARTON
Yeah.
CHARLIE
What do you think happened?
BARTON
I don't know! Maybe it was her...
boyfriend. I passed out. I don't
know. Won't the police be able to �
CHARLIE
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend!
This does not look good! They hang
people for this!
BARTON
But I didn't do it � don't you believe
me?
CHARLIE
I believe you � I KNOW you. But why
should the police?
Barton gives him a dumb stare.
CHARLIE
...Did you... Barton, between you
and me, did you have sexual
intercourse?
Barton stares at Charlie. He swallows.
Charlie shakes his head.
CHARLIE
Jesus... They can tell that...
BARTON
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They
gotta have mercy!
CHARLIE
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if
you got cleared eventually, this
would ruin you.
He turns and starts toward the bed.
CHARLIE
...Wait in the bathroom.
BATHROOM
Later. Barton, still in his underwear, sits leaning against
the wall, staring glassily at his feet.
From the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the
sounds of bed clothes being torn off.
Finally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of
Charlie grunting under great weight.
We hear heavy footsteps approaching.
Barton looks up through the open bathroom door.
HIS POV
Charlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the
sheetswaddled body in his arms.
BACK TO BARTON
His neck goes rubbery. His eyes roll up. His head lolls back
to hit the wall.
BLACK
Slap! Slap!
We are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap
and backing away, having aroused Barton. Charlie is now
wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has
blood flecks across the belly.
CHARLIE
You passed out.
Barton looks groggily up.
BARTON
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
CHARLIE
She's dead, Barton! If that was her
name.
TRACKING IN ON BARTON
He stares at Charlie.
CHARLIE
(off)
Barton, listen to me. You gotta act
like nothing's happened. Put this
totally out of your head. I know
that's hard, but your play from here
on out is just to go about business
as usual. Give us some time to sort
this out...
Barton looks at his watch.
THE WATCH
7:45.
CHARLIE
(off)
...Just put it out of you head...
TRACKING
Toward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and
statuary set amid palms trees.
Sunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching
Jack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair.
LIPNIK
Bart! So happy to see ya!
REVERSE
Pulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze.
Barton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much
sun.
LIPNIK
Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then
talk! Drink?
As Barton sits:
BARTON
Yeah... rye whiskey?
LIPNIK
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play
hard! That's what I hear, anyway...
He laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze.
LIPNIK
... Lou.
Lou exits.
LIPNIK
Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're
going along great. Thinks we've got
a real winner in this one. And let
me tell you something, I'm counting
on it. I've taken an interest. Not
to interfere, mind you � hardly seems
necessary in your case. A writer � a
storyteller � of your stature.
Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart.
Gimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting
in the audience, the lights go down,
Capitol logo comes up... you're on!
He beams expectantly at Barton. Barton licks his parched
lips.
BARTON
Yeah, okay... well... we fade in...
Lipnik is nodding, already involved in the story.
BARTON
...It's a tenement building. On the
Lower East Side...
LIPNIK
Great! He's poor, this wrestler!
He's had to struggle!
BARTON
And then... well...
Barton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits
against the sun. He looks back at Lipnik.
BARTON
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
LIPNIK
CAN you? You damn well better be.
Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my
business dealings � well, of course,
you can't always be honest, not with
the sharks swimming around this town
� but if you're a writer, you don't
think about those things � if I'd
been totally honest, I wouldn't be
within a mile of this pool � unless
I was cleaning it. But that's no
reason for you not to be. Honest, I
mean. Not cleaning the pool.
Lou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton.
Lou sits.
Barton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily,
but must finally take the plunge.
BARTON
Well... to be honest, I'm never really
comfortable discussing a work in
progress. I've got it all worked
out in my head, but sometimes if you
force it out in words � prematurely
� the wrong words � well, your meaning
changes, and it changes your own
mind, and you never get it back � so
I'd just as soon not talk about it.
Lipnik stares at him. His smile has disappeared. There is a
long beat.
Lou Breeze clears his throat. He apparently feels obliged to
fill the silence.
LOU
...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never
mind how long I've been in pictures.
Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just
about since they were invented. HE
practically invented them.
Lipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou.
LOU
...Now I think if he's interested in
what one of his contract employees
is doing while he draws pay, I think
that employee ought to tell him, if
he wants to stay an employee. Right
now the contents of your head are
the property of Capitol Pictures, so
if I were you I would speak up. And
pretty goddamn fast.
Lou looks at Barton, expectantly. Lipnik continues to stare
at Lou.
There is a long silence, terribly heavy.
Finally, Lipnik explodes � at Lou.
LIPNIK
You lousy sonofabitch! You're telling
this man � this ARTIST � what to
do?!
Lou Breeze is stunned.
LOU
Mr. Lipnik, I �
LIPNIK
This man creates for a living! He
puts food on your table and on mine!
THANK him for it! Thank him, you
ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or
YOU'RE fired!
Barton is staring, aghast.
BARTON
Mr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-
Lipnik, still staring at Lou, gives no sign of hearing Barton.
He rises and points.
LIPNIK
Get down on your knees, you
sonofabitch! Get down on your knees
and kiss this man's feet!
LOU
Mr. Lipnik, please �
BARTON
I � Mr. Lipnik �
LIPNIK
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
Lou, aghast, looks at Barton.
Barton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look.
Lipnik snarls at Lou:
LIPNIK
...Okay, get out of here. You're
fired, you understand me? Get out
of my sight.
Lou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away.
BARTON
Mr. Lipnik, I �
LIPNIK
I apologize, Barton.
BARTON
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been
a great help �
LIPNIK
You don't have to cover for him.
It's noble of you, but these things
happen in business.
BARTON
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much
better if you could reconsider �
LIPNIK
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to
pull this out of your head. If that
sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to
you, goddammit, I will. I respect
your artistry and your methods, and
if you can't fill us in yet, well
hell, we should be kissing your feet
for your fine efforts.
He gets down on his knees in front of Barton.
LIPNIK
...You know in the old country we
were taught, as very young children,
that there's no shame in supplicatin'
yourself when you respect someone.
Barton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his
feet.
LIPNIK
...On behalf of Capitol Pictures,
the administration, and all a the
stockholders, please accept this as
a symbol of our apology and respect.
BARTON'S POV
Lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him.
Behind Lipnik the pool glitters.
BARTON'S ROOM
The cut has a hard musical sting. Out of the sting comes a
loud but distorted thumping noise.
We are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room.
We are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits,
hunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the
bed in front of him. He wears only trousers and a T-shirt
and his body and face glisten with sweat. The bed's sheets
have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous
rust-red stain in the middle.
After a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene:
A bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near
wall.
Silence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a
knock at the door.
Barton rises slowly and crosses to the door.
THE DOOR
Barton opens it to Charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit,
his hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head.
It is the first time we have seen him well turned out.
A battered briefcase is on the floor next to him. He holds a
parcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in
brown paper and tied up with twine.
CHARLIE
Barton. Can I come in?
Barton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his
briefcase and enters.
THE ROOM
As the two men enter.
BARTON
Jesus... You're leaving.
CHARLIE
Have to, old timer. Just for a while.
Barton sounds desperate:
BARTON
Jesus, Charlie, I...
CHARLIE
Everything's okay, believe me. I
know it's rough mentally, but
everything's taken care of.
BARTON
Charlie! I've got no one else here!
You're the only person I know in Los
Angeles...
He starts weeping
BARTON
...that I can talk to.
Charlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around
Barton.
Barton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder. Charlie is somber.
CHARLIE
It's okay... It's okay...
BARTON
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy
� like I'm losing my mind. I don't
know what to do... I didn't do it,
believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie.
I just...
His breath comes in short gasping heaves.
BARTON
...I just don't know what... to do�
CHARLIE
You gotta get a grip on, brother.
You gotta just carry on � just for a
few days, till I get back. Try and
stay here, keep your door locked.
Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta
keep our heads and we'll figure it
out.
BARTON
Yeah, but Charlie �
CHARLIE
Dammit, don't argue with me. You
asked me to believe you � well I do.
Now don't argue with me.
He looks at Barton for a beat.
CHARLIE
...Look, pal � can you do something
for me?
Charlie hands him his parcel.
CHARLIE
...Keep this for me, till I get back.
Barton, snuffling, accepts the package.
CHARLIE
...It's just personal stuff. I don't
wanna drag it with me, but I don't
trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like
to think it's in good hands.
Still snuffling:
BARTON
Sure, Charlie.
CHARLIE
Funny, huh, when everything that's
important to a guy, everything he
wants to keep from a lifetime � when
he can fit it into a little box like
that. I guess... I guess it's kind
of pathetic.
Wallowing in self-pity:
BARTON
It's more than I've got.
CHARLIE
Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll
bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll
help you finish your script. You'll
think about me...
He thumps his chest.
CHARLIE
...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll
lick that story of yours.
Barton is tearfully sincere:
BARTON
Thanks, Charlie.
Charlie solemnly thrusts out his hand.
CHARLIE
Yeah, well, see you soon, friend.
You're gonna be fine.
Barton shakes. As they walk to the door:
BARTON
You'll be back?
CHARLIE
Don't worry about that, compadre.
I'll be back.
Barton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns
around.
HIS POV
The room. The bed. The blood-stained mattress.
Barton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge
of the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain. For a long beat,
he sits still, but something is building inside.
Finally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator
arriving for Charlie, it erupts:
Barton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abandoned
child.
HIGH WIDE SHOT
Barton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust-colored
stain.
FADE OUT
FADE IN:
BATHING BEAUTY
With the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up.
We pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been
tucked into a corner of the picture frame: it is the snap of
Charlie, smiling and waving, with his foot up on the running
board of the 1939 Ford roadster.
BARTON
Sitting at the desk, staring at the picture. From his glazed
eyes and the way his mouth hangs open, we may assume he has
been staring at the picture for some time.
He notices something on the desk and picks it up.
HIS POV
The Holy Bible � Placed by the Gideons.
Barton opens it, randomly, to the Book of Daniel. The text
is set in ornately Gothic type.
""5. And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the
Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known
unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in
pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill.""
BARTON
Staring at the passage. His mouth hangs open.
THE BIBLE
Barton riffles to the first page.
In bold type at the top:
""THE BOOK OF GENESIS""
Underneath, in the same ornately Gothic type:
""Chapter One 1. Fade in on a tenement building on Manhattan's
Lower East Side. Faint traffic noise is audible; 2. As is
the cry of fishmongers.""
BARTON
Squinting at the page through bloodshot eyes.
His mouth hangs open.
BARTON'S ROOM � DAY
At the cut the harsh clackety-clack of typing bangs in.
Sunlight burns against the sheers of Barton's window, making
it a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains
fairly dim.
Barton sits at the secretary, typing furiously.
He finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places
it face-down on a short stack of face-down pages.
He feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing. He
is sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we
left him the previous night.
The telephone rings. After several rings Barton stops typing
and answers it, absently, still looking at his work. His
voice is hoarse.
BARTON
Hello... Chet... Who?...
He puts the receiver down on the desk, leans over the
typewriter, and examines something he has just written.
He picks the phone back up and listens for a beat.
BARTON
... No, don't send them up here.
I'll be right down.
ELEVATOR
A small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator.
We pan down to Barton, who is riding down with Pete, the old
elevator operator. Barton's voice is hoarse with fatigue.
BARTON
...You read the Bible, Pete?
PETE
Holy Bible?
BARTON
Yeah.
PETE
I think so... Anyway, I've heard
about it.
Barton nods.
They ride for a beat.
LOBBY
Late afternoon sun slants in from one side. The lobby has
the same golden ambiance as when first we saw it.
Barton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows,
from which two men in suits are rising. One is tall, the
other short.
POLICEMAN
Fink?
BARTON
Yeah.
POLICEMAN #2
Detective Mastrionotti.
POLICEMAN #1
Detective Deutsch.
MASTRIONOTTI
L.A.P.D.
BARTON
Uh-huh.
All three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs. Mastrionotti
perches on the edge of his chair; Deutsch slumps back in the
shadows, studying Barton.
DEUTSCH
Got a couple questions to ask ya.
MASTRIONOTTI
What do you do, Fink?
Still hoarse:
BARTON
I write.
DEUTSCH
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
BARTON
Well as a matter of fact, I write
for the pictures.
MASTRIONOTTI
Big fuckin' deal.
DEUTSCH
You want my partner to kiss your
ass?
MASTRIONOTTI
Would that be good enough for ya?
BARTON
No, I � I didn't mean to sound �
DEUTSCH
What DID you mean?
BARTON
I � I've got respect for � for working
guys, like you �
MASTRIONOTTI
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You
live in 605?
BARTON
Yeah.
DEUTSCH
How long you been up there, Fink?
BARTON
A week, eight, nine days �
MASTRIONOTTI
Is this multiple choice?
BARTON
Nine days � Tuesday �
DEUTSCH
You know this slob?
He is holding a small black-and-white photograph out toward
Barton.
There is a long beat as Barton studies the picture.
BARTON
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to
me.
MASTRIONOTTI
That's right, Fink, he lives next
door to you.
DEUTSCH
Ever talk to him?
BARTON
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie
Meadows.
MASTRIONOTTI
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
DEUTSCH
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
MASTRIONOTTI
Also known as Madman Mundt.
DEUTSCH
He's a little funny in the head.
BARTON
What did... What did he �
MASTRIONOTTI
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate
people with a shotgun and then cut
their heads off.
DEUTSCH
Yeah, he's funny that way.
BARTON
I...
MASTRIONOTTI
Started in Kansas City. Couple of
housewives.
DEUTSCH
Couple of days ago we see the same
M.O. out in Los Feliz.
MASTRIONOTTI
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
DEUTSCH
All of which he's now missin'.
MASTRIONOTTI
Well, some of his throat was there.
DEUTSCH
Physician, heal thyself.
MASTRIONOTTI
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
DEUTSCH
Anyway.
MASTRIONOTTI
Hollywood precinct finds another
stiff yesterday. Not too far from
here. This one's better looking than
the doc.
DEUTSCH
Female caucasian, thirty years old.
Nice tits. No head. You ever see
Mundt with anyone meets that
description?
MASTRIONOTTI
But, you know, with the head still
on.
BARTON
...No. I never saw him with anyone
else.
DEUTSCH
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
BARTON
Nothing, really. Said he was in the
insurance business.
Deutsch indicates Mastrionotti.
DEUTSCH
Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.
MASTRIONOTTI
No reputable company would hire a
guy like that.
BARTON
Well that's what he said.
DEUTSCH
What else?
BARTON
He... I'm trying to think... Nothing,
really... He... He said he liked
Jack Oakie pictures.
Mastrionotti looks at Deutsch. Deutsch looks at Mastrionotti.
After a beat, Mastrionotti looks back at Barton.
MASTRIONOTTI
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say
anything you might remember could be
helpful. But I'll be frank with you:
That is not helpful.
DEUTSCH
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
MASTRIONOTTI
Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't
it?
BARTON
Yeah.
Mastrionotti gets to his feet, looking around the lobby.
MASTRIONOTTI
Yeah, I didn't think this dump was
restricted.
He digs in his pocket.
MASTRIONOTTI
...Mundt has disappeared. I don't
think he'll be back. But...
He hands Barton a card.
MASTRIONOTTI
...give me a call if you see him. Or
if you remember something that isn't
totally idiotic.
BARTON'S ROOM
We are tracking toward the paper-wrapped parcel that sits on
the nightstand next to Barton's bed.
Barton enters and picks it up. He holds it for a beat, looking
at it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits.
He shakes it.
No sound; whatever is inside is well packed.
Barton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat,
as if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf.
Finally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the
bathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily.
DISSOLVE
THROUGH TO:
REVERSE
Some time later; Barton still types. He is face to us; beyond
him we can see the bed with its rust-colored stain.
The phone rings. Barton ignores it. It continues to ring.
Barton rises and exits frame; we hold on to the bed in the
background. We hear Barton's footsteps on the bathroom tile
as the phone continues ringing.
Barton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear.
He resumes typing.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Barton typing. The desk trembles under the working of the
typewriter. Charlie's parcel chatters.
Barton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places
it face down on the growing stack to his right. He feeds in
a new page. We hear the muted ding of the elevator down the
hall. Barton resumes typing.
We hear a knock on Barton's door. Barton does not react,
apparently not hearing.
THE DOORWAY
We are close on the bottom of the door. Someone in the hallway
is sliding a note beneath the door; then his shadow disappears
and his footsteps recede.
The note is a printed message headed: ""While You Were Out...
"" Underneath are the printed words: ""You were called by""
and, handwritten in the space following: ""Mr. Ben Geisler.""
Handwritten below, in the message space:
""Thank you. Lipnik loved your meeting. Keep up the good work.""
Barton's offscreen typing continues steadily.
FADE OUT
HALLWAY
A perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty
hall. Shoes are set put in front of each door except for
one in the middle background.
At the cut in we hear faint, regular typing.
We hold for a beat. There is no motion. The long, empty hall.
The distant typing.
We hold.
The typing stops. There is a beat of quiet.
It is broken by the sound of a door opening. It is the
shoeless door in the middle background.
A hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway.
The hand withdraws.
The door closes.
A short beat of silence.
The distant typing resumes.
The long empty hall. The distant typing.
FADE OUT
OVER THE BLACK
We hear the distant sound of a woman's voice, tinny and
indistinct.
WOMAN
Just a minute and I'll connect you...
FADE IN:
CLOSE ON BARTON
His eyes are red-rimmed and wild. He sits on the edge of his
bed holding the phone to his ear.
His voice is unnaturally loud:
BARTON
Hello? Operator! I can't... Oh!
He stops, reaches up, takes a cotton wad out of his ear.
We hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines
switch, and then a distant ring. The phone rings three or
four times before it is answered by a groggy voice.
VOICE
...Hello.
BARTON
Garland, it's me.
GARLAND
Barton? What time is it? Are you all
right?
BARTON
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland � I have to
talk to you. I'm calling long
distance.
GARLAND
Okay.
Muffled, we hear Garland speaking to someone else.
GARLAND
...It's Barton. Calling long distance.
Back into the receiver:
GARLAND
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
BARTON
I'm fine, garland, but I have to
talk with you.
GARLAND
Go ahead, son.
BARTON
It's about what I'm writing, Garland.
It's really... I think it's really
big.
GARLAND
What do you mean, Barton?
BARTON
Not big in the sense of large �
although it's that too. I mean
important. This may be the most
IMPORTANT work I've done.
GARLAND
Well, I'm... glad to hear that �
BARTON
Very important, Garland. I just
thought you should know that. Whatever
happens.
GARLAND
...That's fine.
BARTON
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
GARLAND
...Barton, is everything okay?
BARTON
Yes... Isn't it?
GARLAND
Well, I'm just asking. You sound a
little �
Guardedly:
BARTON
Sound a little what?
GARLAND
Well, you just... sound a little�
Bitterly:
BARTON
Thanks, Garland. Thanks for all the
encouragement.
He slams down the phone.
OVER HIS SHOULDER
A one-quarter shot on Barton from behind as he picks up the
cotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear.
He resumes typing, furiously.
After a beat he mutters, still typing.
BARTON
...Nitwit.
THE BATHING BEAUTY
Later. We hear typing and the roar of the surf.'
CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER
We are extremely close on the key-strike area. As we cut in
Barton is typing:
""p-o-s-t-c-a-r-d-.""
The carriage returns a couple of times and ""T-H-E�E-N-D"" is
typed in.
The paper is ripped out of the carriage.
CLOSE ON A STACK OF PAGES
Lying face down on the desk; the last page is added, face
down, to the pile. The pile is picked up, its edges are
straightened with a couple of thumps against the desktop,
and then the pile is replaced on the desk, face up. The
title page reads:
""THE BURLYMAN
Motion Picture Scenario
By
Barton Fink""
Barton's right hand enters frame to deposit a small cotton
wad on top of the script.
Barton's left hand enters to deposit another small cotton
wad on top of the script.
We hear Barton walk away. We hear bath water run.
THE BATHING BEAUTY
Still looking out to sea.
USO HALL
We are booming down to the dance floor as a raucous band
plays an up-tempo number.
BARTON
Dancing animatedly, almost maniacally, his fingers jabbing
the air.
The hall is crowded, but Barton is one of few men not in
uniform.
USO GIRL
Giggling, dancing opposite Barton.
GIRL
You're cute!
BARTON
Caught up in his dancing, oblivious to the girl.
A white uniformed arm reaches in to tap Barton on the
shoulder.
SAILOR
'Scuse me, buddy, mind if I cut in?
Barton glares at him.
BARTON
This is MY dance, sailor!
SAILOR
C'mon buddy, I'm shipping out
tomorrow.
For some reason, Barton is angry.
BARTON
I'm a writer! Celebrating the
completion of something GOOD! Do
you understand that, sailor? I'm a
WRITER!
His bellowing has drawn onlookers' attention.
VOICES
Step aside, four-eyes! Let someone
else spin the dame! Give the navy a
dance! Hey, Four-F, take a hike!
Barton turns furiously against the crowd.
BARTON
I'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE!
He points at his head.
BARTON
...This is my uniform!
He taps his skull.
BARTON
...THIS is how I serve the common
man! THIS is where I �
WHAPP! An infantry man tags Barton's chin on the button.
Bodies surge. The crowd gasps. The band blares nightmarishly
on.
HOTEL HALLWAY
Quiet at the cut.
After a beat, there is a faint ding at the end of the hall
and, as the elevator door opens, we faintly hear:
PETE
This stop: six.
Barton, disheveled, emerges and stumbles wearily down the
hall. He stops in front of his door, takes his key out, and
enters the room.
BARTON'S POV
Mastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading
Barton's manuscript.
Deutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing
beauty.
MASTRIONOTTI
Mother: What is to become of him.
Father: We'll be hearing from that
crazy wrestler. And I don't mean a
postcard. Fade out. The end.
He looks up at Barton.
MASTRIONOTTI
...I thought you said you were a
writer.
DEUTSCH
I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.
BARTON
Keep your filthy eyes off that.
Deutsch turns toward Barton and throws a folded newspaper at
him.
DEUTSCH
You made morning papers, Fink.
Barton opens the paper. A headline reads: Writer Found
Headless in Chavez Ravine. The story has two pictures � a
studio publicity portrait of Mayhew, and a photograph of the
crime scene: two plainclothes detectives stare down into a
gulley as a uniformed cop restrains a pair of leashed dogs.
MASTRIONOTTI
Second one of your friends to end up
dead.
DEUTSCH
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
With a jerk of his thumb, Mastrionotti indicates the
bloodstained bed.
MASTRIONOTTI
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
DEUTSCH
Give you nose bleeds?
Barton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed,
staring at the newspaper.
DEUTSCH
Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd
you put their heads?
Distractedly:
BARTON
Charlie... Charlie's back...
MASTRIONOTTI
No kidding, bright boy � we smelt
Mundt all over this. Was he the idea
man?
DEUTSCH
Tell us where the heads are, maybe
they'll go easy on you.
MASTRIONOTTI
Only fry you once.
Barton rubs his temples.
BARTON
Could you come back later? It's
just... too hot... My head is killing
me.
DEUTSCH
All right, forget the heads. Where's
Mundt, Fink?
MASTRIONOTTI
He teach you to do it?
DEUTSCH
You two have some sick sex thing?
BARTON
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
MASTRIONOTTI
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
DEUTSCH
All right, moron, you're under arrest.
Barton seems oblivious to the two men.
BARTON
Charlie's back. It's hot... He's
back.
Down the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator.
Mastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look.
He rises and walks slowly out into the hall. Deutsch wathces
him go.
HIS POV
Mastrionotti in the hallway in full shot, framed by the door,
still looking puzzled.
MASTRIONOTTI
...Fred...
Deutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on
his hip, revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt. He
unhitches the cuffs and slips one around Barton's right wrist
and the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of
the bed.
DEUTSCH
Sit tight, Fink.
THE HALLWAY
As Deutsch joins Mastrionotti.
DEUTSCH
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?
MASTRIONOTTI
...Fred...
Deutsch looks where Mastrionotti is looking.
THE WALL
Tacky yellow fluid streams down. The walls are pouring sweat.
The hallway is quiet.
MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
They look at each other. They look down the hall.
THEIR POV
The elevator stands open at the far end of the empty hall.
For a long beat, nothing.
Finally Pete, the elevator man, emerges.
At this distance, he is a small figure, stumbling this way
and that, his hands presseed against the sides of his head.
He turns to face Mastrionotti and Deutsch and takes a few
steps forward, still clutching his head.
MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
Watching.
PETE
He takes on last step, then collapses.
As he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head. His
head separates from his neck, hits the floor, and rolls away
from his body with a dull irregular trundle sound.
MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
Wide-eyed, they look at each other, then back down the hall.
All is quiet.
THE HALLWAY
Smoke is beginning to drift into the far end of the hall.
We hear a muted rumble.
MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
Mastrionotti tugs at his tie. He slowly unholsters his gun.
Deutsch slowly, hypnotically, follows suit.
DEUTSCH
... Show yourself, Mundt!
More quiet.
THE HALLWAY
More smoke.
LOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR
The crack where the floor of the elevator meets that of the
hall.
It flickers with red light from below. Bottom-lit smoke sifts
up.
CLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI
Standing in the foreground, gun at ready. Sweat pours down
his face.
Behind him, Deutsch stands nervously in the light-spill from
Barton's doorway.
The rumble and crackle of fire grows louder.
THE HALLWAY
More smoke.
PATCH OF WALL
Sweating.
A swath of wallpaper sags away from the top of the wall,
exposing glistening lath underneath.
With a light airy pop, the lathwork catches on fire.
MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH
Sweating.
DEUTSCH
...Mundt!
THEIR POV
The hallway. Its end-facing-wall slowly spreads flame from
where the wallpaper droops.
LOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR
More red bottom-lit smoke seeps up from the crack between
elevator and hallway floors.
With a groan of tension relieved cables and a swaying of the
elevator door, a pair of feet crosses the threshold into the
doorway.
JUMPING BACK
Wide on the hallway. Charlie Meadows has emerged from the
elevator and is hellishly backlit by the flame.
His suit coat hangs open. His hat is pushed back on his head.
From his right hand his briefcase dangles.
He stands motionless, facing us. There is something monumental
in his posture, shoulders thrown back.
MASTRIONOTTI
Tensed. Behind him, Deutsch gulps.
MASTRIONOTTI
There's a boy, Mundt. Put the policy
case down and your mitts in the air.
CHARLIE
He leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor.
CLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI
Relax. He murmurs:
MASTRIONOTTI
He's complying.
BACK TO CHARLIE
He straightens up from the briefcase, a sawed-off shotgun in
his hands.
BOOM! The shotgun spits fire.
Mastrionotti's face is peppered by buckshot and he is blown
back down the hallway into Deutsch.
Bellowing fills the hallway over the roar of the fire:
CHARLIE
LOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL
SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!
THE HALLWAY
The fire starts racing down the hallway.
CLOSE STEEP ANGLE ON PATCH OF WALL
Fire races along the wall-sweat goopus.
TRACK IN ON DEUTSCH
His eyes widen at Charlie and the approaching fire; his gun
dangles forgotten from his right hand.
HIS POV
Charlie is charging down the hallway, holding his shotgun
loosely in front of his chest, in double-time position. The
fire races along with him.
He is bellowing:
CHARLIE
LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE
OF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE
OF THE MIND!
DEUTSCH
Terrified, he turns and runs.
REVERSE PULLING DEUTSCH
As he runs down the flaming hallway, pursued by flames, smoke,
and Karl Mundt � who, also on the run, levels his shotgun.
BOOM!
PUSHING DEUTSCH
His legs and feet spout blood, paddle futilely at the air,
then come down in a twisting wobble, like a car on blown
tires, and pitch him helplessly to the floor.
PULLING CHARLIE
He slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun.
PUSHING DEUTSCH
Weeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows.
PULLING CHARLIE
He slows to a walk.
BARTON'S ROOM
Barton strains at his handcuffs.
HIS POV
Through the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two
shells into his shotgun.
PULLING DEUTSCH
Charlie looms behind him and � THWACK � snaps the shotgun
closed.
Deutsch rolls over to rest on his elbows, facing Charlie.
Charlie primes the shotgun � CLACK.
He presses both barrels against the bridge of Deutsh's nose.
CHARLIE
Heil Hitler.
DEUTSCH
Screams.
CHARLIE
Tightens a finger over both triggers. He squeezes.
BLAM!
TRACK IN ON BARTON
He flinches.
The gunshot echoes away.
Barton strains at the handcuffs.
We hear Charlie's footsteps approach � slowly, heavily.
THE DOORWAY
Charlie, walking down the hall, glances in and seems mildly
surprised to see Barton. The set of his jaw relaxes. His
expression softens. He pushes his hat farther back on his
head.
CHARLIE
Barton!
He shakes is head and whistles.
CHARLIE
...Brother, is it hot.
He walks into the room.
BARTON'S ROOM
As Charlie wearily enters.
CHARLIE
How you been, buddy?
He props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing Barton, who
stared at him.
CHARLIE
...Don't look at me like that,
neighbor. It's just me � Charlie.
BARTON
I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.
Charlie reaches a flask from his pocket.
CHARLIE
Jesus, people can be cruel...
He takes a long draught from his flask, then gives a haunted
stare.
CHARLIE
...if it's not my build, it's my
personality.
Charlie is perspiring heavily. The fire rumbles in the
hallway.
CHARLIE
...They say I'm a madman, Barton,
but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest
I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry
for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to
think about what they're going
through. How trapped they are. I
understand it. I feel for 'em. So I
try and help them out...
He reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button.
CHARLIE
...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels
like, when things get all balled up
at the head office. It puts you
through hell, Barton. So I help people
out. I just wish someone would do as
much for me...
He stares miserably down at his feet.
CHARLIE
...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets
so hot, I wanna crawl right out of
my skin.
Self-pity:
BARTON
But Charlie � why me? Why �
CHARLIE
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
A tacky yellow fluid is dripping from Charlie's left ear and
running down his cheek.
CHARLIE
...Jesus, I'm dripping again.
He pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear.
CHARLIE
...C'mon Barton, you think you know
about pain? You think I made your
life hell? Take a look around this
dump. You're just a tourist with a
typewriter, Barton. I live here.
Don't you understand that...
His voice is becoming choked.
CHARLIE
...And you come into MY home... And
you complain that I'M making too...
much... noise.
He looks up at Barton.
There is a long silence.
Finally:
BARTON
...I'm sorry.
Wearily:
CHARLIE
Don't be.
He rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the
foot of the bed.
The two men regard each other.
Charlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring
at Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His
neck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense. His face
is a reddening grimace.
With a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to which
Barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton
slides the cuff off it, free.
Charlie gets to his feet.
CHARLIE
I'm getting off the merry-go-round.
He takes his shotgun and walks to the door.
CHARLIE
...I'll be next door if you need me.
A thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Barton.
Behind him the hallway blazes.
CHARLIE
...Oh, I dropped in on your folks.
And Uncle Dave?
He smiles. Barton looks at him dumbly.
CHARLIE
...Good people. By the way, that
package I gave you? I lied. It isn't
mine.
He leaves.
Barton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script.
THE HALLWAY
As Barton emerges. Flames lick the walls, causing the
wallpaper to run with the tack glue sap. Smoke fills the
hallway. Barton looks down the hall.
HIS POV
Charlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase
dangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket
for his key.
With his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped
with fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel
after a long hard day on the road.
He opens the door and goes into his room.
BACK TO BARTON
He turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand,
the parcel in the other.
A horrible moaning sound � almost human � can be heard under
the roar of the fire.
BLACKNESS
STUDIO HALLWAY
We are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive
building. From offscreen we hear:
BARTON
Fink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty-
five Fulton Street!
Filtered through phone:
OPERATOR
I understand that, sir �
BARTON
Or Uncle Dave!
Our track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground,
unshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone. In a hallway
in the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry
up.
OPERATOR
I understand that, sir, but there's
still no answer. Shall I check for
trouble on the line?
Barton slams down the phone.
LIPNIK'S OFFICE
Barton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel.
Lou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton.
Lipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window.
LIPNIK
Fink.
BARTON
Mr. Lipnik.
LIPNIK
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
He turns to face Barton and we see that he is wearing a
smartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the
chest.
LIPNIK
...Siddown.
Barton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk.
LIPNIK
...I was commissioned yesterday in
the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau
arranged it. He's a dear friend.
BARTON
Congratulations.
LIPNIK
Actually it hasn't officially gone
through yet. Had wardrobe whip this
up. You gotta pull teeth to get
anything done in this town. I can
understand a little red tape in
peacetime, but now it's all-out
warfare against the Japs. Little
yellow bastards. They'd love to see
me sit this one out.
BARTON
Yes sir, they �
LIPNIK
Anyway, I had Lou read your script
for me.
He taps distastefully at the script on his desk, which has a
slightly charred title page.
LIPNIK
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't
wash.
BARTON
With all due respect, sir, I think
it's the best work I've done.
LIPNIK
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion
mattered, then I guess I'd resign
and let YOU run the the studio. It
doesn't and you won't, and the
lunatics are not going to run THIS
particular asylum. So let's put a
stop to THAT rumor right now.
Listlessly:
BARTON
Yes sir.
LIPNIK
I had to call Beery this morning,
let him know we were pushing the
picture back. After all I'd told
him about quality, about that Barton
Fink feeling. How disappointed we
were. Wally was heartbroken. The man
was devastated. He was � well, I
didn't actually call him, Lou did.
But that's a fair description, isn't
it Lou?
LOU
Yes, Colonel.
LIPNIK
Hell, I could take you through it
step by step, explain why your story
stinks, but I won't insult your
intelligence. Well all right, first
of all: This is a wrestling picture;
the audience wants to see action,
drama, wrestling, and plenty of it.
They don't wanna see a guy wrestling
with his soul � well, all right, a
little bit, for the critics � but
you make it the carrot that wags the
dog. Too much of it and they head
for exits and I don't blame 'em.
There's plenty of poetry right inside
that ring, Fink. Look at ""Hell Ten
Feet Square"".
LOU
""Blood, Sweat, and Canvas"".
LIPNIK
Look at ""Blood, Sweat, and Canvas"".
These are big movies, Fink. About
big men, in tights � both physically
and mentally. But especially
physically. We don't put Wallace
Beery in some fruity movie about
suffering � I thought we were together
on that.
BARTON
I'm sorry if I let you down.
LIPNIK
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou.
We don't live or die by what you
scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler
down. He liked you. Trusted you. And
that's why he's gone. Fired. That
guy had a heart as big as the
outdoors, and you fucked him. He
tried to convince me to fire you
too, but that would be too easy. No,
you're under contract and you're
gonna stay that way. Anything you
write will be the property of Capitol
Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will
not produce anything you write. Not
until you grow up a little. You ain't
no writer, Fink � you're a goddamn
write-off.
BARTON
I tried to show you something
beautiful. Something about all of
US �
This sets Lipnik off:
LIPNIK
You arrogant sonofabitch! You think
you're the only writer who can give
me that Barton Fink feeling?! I got
twenty writers under contract that I
can ask for a Finktype thing from.
You swell-headed hypocrite! You
just don't get it, do you? You think
the whole world revolves inside
whatever rattles inside that little
kike head of yours. Get him outta my
sight, Lou. Make sure he stays in
town, though; he's still under
contract. I want you in town, Fink,
and outta my sight. Now get lost.
There's a war on.
THE SURF
Crashing against the Pacific shore.
THE BEACH
At midday, almost deserted. In the distance we see Barton
walking.
The paper-wrapped parcel swings from the twine in his left
hand.
BARTON
He walks a few more paces and sits down on the sand, looking
out to see. His gaze shifts to one side.
HIS POV
Down the beach, a bathing beauty walks along the edge of the
water. She looks much like the picture on the wall in Barton's
hotel room.
BARTON
He stares, transfixed, at the woman.
THE WOMAN
Very beautiful, backlit by the sun, approaching.
BARTON
Following her with his eyes.
THE WOMAN
Her eyes meet Barton's. She says something, but her voice is
lost in the crash of the surf.
Barton cups a hand to his ear.
BEAUTY
I said it's a beautiful day...
BARTON
Yes... It is...
BEAUTY
What's in the box?
Barton shrugs and shakes his head.
BARTON
I don't know.
BEAUTY
Isn't it yours?
BARTON
I... I don't know...
She nods and sits down on the sand several paces away from
him, facing the water but looking back over her shoulder at
Barton.
BARTON
...You're very beautiful. Are you in
pictures?
She laughs.
BEAUTY
Don't be silly.
She turns away to look out at the sea.
WIDER
Facing the ocean. Barton sits in the middle foreground, back
to us, the box in the sand next to him.
The bathing beauty sits, back to us, in the middle background.
The surf pounds.
The sun sparkles off the water.

Screenplay By Sam Hamm
FIRST DRAFT
NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS.
THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY.
NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON-
PREFORMAT FONT ""BOOKMAN OLD"". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED TO
PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK
It's finally happened. Hell's frozen over.
Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting. Peace has
been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello. Salvation
Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners. And now, as
night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
""JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
Christmas.""
The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers. At a souvenir
store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
year old. Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
chains, ceramic figurines. The kid is already wearing a
Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
wants more.
Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading ""AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
BATWING -- $19.95 and up."" A PANHANDLER is perched at the
entrance. Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
with the familiar yellow-and-black logo. In Gotham this
winter, Batmania is everywhere...
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
blizzard. The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
all but empty of cars. A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...
...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
bundled up in mufflers and parkas. Unbothered by the weather,
they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
the few passersby.
They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of ""Silent
Night"" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow. Its sides
are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
of year.
A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
as it rounds a corner. The CAROLERS carol. Then --
-- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.
EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets. The windows
have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store. Gut-shot
SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.
CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic. The POLAR
BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...
The REAR DOORS open. A RAMP slides down from the back of the
truck. The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.
SIRENS HOWL. A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
into a drift.
INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
snow -- no traction. They're about to climb out and give
chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
Salvation Army SANTA...
...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM. The
windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
burdened with LOOT.
EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH. The COP CARS skid
to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW. By now, of
course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.
EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER. A couple
of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
avoid getting run over. Every time they poke their heads out,
another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.
The ROBBERS fan out in various directions. These guys are
obviously going to get away clean -- unless...
The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...
INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
MORE SIRENS. A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
streets which is relatively clear. The COP at the wheel goes
wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.
Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.
COP
What the hell -- ?
EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
BRAKES SQUEAL. Several squad cars are now massed at the
entrance to the park -- but there's one problem. The city's
snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading ""CLOSED TO TRAFFIC."" A
huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
snowmobiles vanish into the trees.
The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
a plan. A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
of the park. Another is at his car, barking into a radio
mike:
COP WITH MIKE
Yeah, you heard me. Snowmobiles!
(pause)
So what do we do? Chase 'em on foot??
ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn. The COPS peer down the
long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
stopping...
THE BATMOBILE!! COPS dive left and right. A split-second
later...
...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
ice and snow on the paths before it into water!
The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye. The COPS
get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating. One of
them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:
COP I
...That was Batman.
COP II
NO SHIT!!
COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
follow suit. ENGINES REV. As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
a path, they might as well join in the chase...
EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT
TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
speeding SKIDOOS. Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
horizon...
...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH. Thrilled beyond words, they
WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.
INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT
His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
from the front of the car. Cool as ever -- approaching the
chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.
EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
The cops follow along in BATMAN's path. The lead car LOSES
CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift. The DRIVER jams the
pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
ice. He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
COPS race past him on foot.
INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
over the hilly terrain of the park. He spots two of them up
ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
left and right...
ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING
PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
into place. The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
disappear.
ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING
The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
GAINING FAST. He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
always seems to follow. Just as he approaches the crest of a
hill...
...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE. The
force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off. His LOOT lands
in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.
ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING
This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy. When he sees
the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
GROVE OF TREES. The trees are too closely spaced for the
torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
explodes harmlessly.
The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
Batmobile can't follow either. But BATMAN has a Plan B. As
he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
passing the snowmobile on its left. A STEEL SPIKE attached to
a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
ITSELF into a distant TREE.
The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
path of the second SNOWMOBILE. The vehicle crashes into the
trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
heels into a drift.
In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
ready for mop-up duty. BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.
EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT
We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm. They
look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
disappear over a crest of a hill...
EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4
They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
of a frozen-over LAKE. With the roar of the Batmobile behind
them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
of the lake.
Now the Batmobile crests the ridge. The car's weight tips
suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope. The
prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --
-- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack. The left
front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
sliding forward.
INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
purchase. He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --
EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE
-- and the trunk pops open. An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.
INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN
Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
vanishing into the distance. He opens (yet another) panel on
the dashboard...
EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4
The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up. They're almost
halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...
Fireworks? No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
-- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
know what's hit them.
ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING
The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
not with toys, but precious stones. He approaches the edge of
the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
outcroppings. He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
clearing...
...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
behind him. The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
to build up speed.
As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
flamethrower. But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
the Batmobile rises half a foot --
-- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air. A heavy NET is
strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
tracks.
Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
Batmobile barrels down. When the great black machine is
almost atop him --
-- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
frame.
EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT
The COPS are spread out near the entrance. They've rounded up
the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot. They hear a
dull ROAR in the distance...
...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.
At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
vanishes whence it came. A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
colleague and SHRUGS:
COP I
...Merry Christmas.
The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.
COP II
Gift-wrapped and everything.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. CITY HALL - DAY
TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
with a sizable crowd watching from the street. COMMISSIONER
GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.
GORDON
After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
in precious jewels were recovered intact
by the police force -- working in concert
with Batman.
At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
crowd:
VOICES IN CROWD
TAKE BACK THE STREETS! TAKE BACK THE
STREETS! TAKE BACK THE --
GORDON winces and lets out a sigh. The CHANTERS are a group
of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS. They're
obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
saw in the park.
GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
over the din.
GORDON
I would like to stress -- that while this
city enjoys a special relationship with
Batman --
(louder)
-- we do not condone vigilantism --
(practically screaming)
-- IN ANY FORM.
It's no use. He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
continue to shout and shake their fists. Giving up, he
returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
huff. The RED BERETS CHEER.
CUT TO:
INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
Square. A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
RED BERET as ""MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
BAT.""
SEKOWSKY
And hey! Where does this --
(BLEEP; expletive deleted)
-- Gordon get off calling us ?
We're not breakin' any laws. We're a
group of concerned citizens, that's all --
just like Batman.
WOMAN IN CROWD
You people are nothing but hoodlums!
SEKOWSKY
Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
like you.
(into mike)
If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --
MORE CATCALLS from the crowd. The picture jumps suddenly as a
minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
breaking out. Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
screen, placing us in:
INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT
where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
with extreme dismay. As he trims the crusts from a pair of
hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.
ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
the mike...
SEKOWSKY (on TV)
We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
alive in this city. We're gonna take back
the streets!
SEKOWSKY raises a fist. Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
chant: ""TAKE BACK THE STREETS! TAKE BACK THE STREETS!""
Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
flicks it off.
He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
""Good King Wenceslas"" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
Sterling silver tea service.
INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
mahogany desk. He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
side drawer.
The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads ""THOMAS WAYNE
MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed."" ALFRED digs
around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
the rear of the drawer.
Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...
INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
""Good King Wenceslas"" is on the speakers down here as well.
Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
wrapped in a tarp.
ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
service down. He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
simultaneously. He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
BRUCE.
ALFRED
Sir? -- MASTER BRUCE??
As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
recesses of the cavern. ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS.
BRUCE
I'm not deaf, Alfred. I hear you.
He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
buckled about his waist. Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
midair for a moment, dangling over the void. ALFRED slowly
regains his composure:
ALFRED
I took the liberty of preparing tea.
(indicating tbe monitors)
I take it you've been watching the news?
BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
and nods.
BRUCE
Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.
BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum. He kicks off
on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt. Preoccupied, he drops
his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.
ALFRED
I should inform you...Christmas is
approaching, and we've received our annual
solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
(eyeing the equipment)
If I may inquire...?
BRUCE
Oh, yeah. Watch this.
BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
tubing. The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
like the skeleton of an umbrella.
ALFRED
Most ingenious, sir. What exactly it?
BRUCE
What does it look like?
ALFRED
To the untrained eye, sir, it looks
remarkably like...the skeleton of an
umbrella.
Sounds good. BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over,
smiles slyly.
BRUCE
Good guess, Alfred. That's exactly right.
BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss. He
sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap,
pours a cup of tea.
ALFRED
Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad
you're putting your time to such
productive use.
(beat)
Now -- the Toy Fund. Our contribution
last year was a half-million dollars...
BRUCE
We can do better than that.
ALFRED
Then there's the foster-parents program...
the Gotham homeless crusade...
BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich. He seems
oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts
are obviously a million miles away. ALFRED looks on,
concerned:
ALFRED (cont.)
Is something troubling you, sir?
BRUCE
Yeah...the holidays, I guess. Always gets
me thinking about...
(he changes the subject)
And to tell you the truth, I'm a little --
concerned about Vicki.
ALFRED
(anxiously)
Miss Vale, sir...?
BRUCE
Yeah. I've been thinking about it lately.
Thinking about it a lot...
(gravely; shaking his head)
...and I still can't figure out what to
get her for Christmas.
BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED
heaves an audible sigh of relief as we
CUT TO:
INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare
concrete wall. Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen
of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons,
cardinals, titwillows...
CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY
ODD FIGURE in prison greys. A CANARY, perched on his
shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy,
cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS
with quick, birdlike strokes.
MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems
his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is
""obscene."" Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports
himself with overblown, theatrical dignity. Fastidious and
preening, he does not suffer insults lightly.
CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars --
and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged. A PRISON
GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door...
GUARD
Up and at 'em, Pengy. -- Pengy?
MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to
acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname.
GUARD (cont.)
Boniface...
MR. BONIFACE finally turns. With an expression of extreme
distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the
canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.
INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY
MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from
the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD.
PAROLE OFFICER
You want to return the money you stole.
BONIFACE
Intact. The map will show you where it's
buried.
The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP.
PAROLE OFFICER
All of it. Forty-two million dollars.
MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds
the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to
bear.
PAROLE OFFICER II
Why this sudden change of heart?
MR. BONIFACE
Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in
full. I want to be a part of civilized
society!
(oozing sincerity)
Prison life is not for me. The guilt, the
fear, the constant shame...one meets a
disturbingly low class of people.
PAROLE OFFICER II
Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars??
MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively. It's quite a perfomlance. He
dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and
he's the delicate type...
WARDEN
His record's clean. Thirteen years
without an incident.
ATTORNEY
I'd like to point out, my client's put his
time to good use. A student of
ornithology...articles published in
several respected journals...
The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird
World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg.
MR. BONIFACE
Birds, yes. My only source of solace.
PAROLE OFFICER
In light of this rather extraordinary
gesture, I see no reason not to endorse
your application for parole.
BONIFACE
Thank you, sir. You won't regret it.
MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE
BOARD. As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD
SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office:
MYNAH
CRIME DOES NOT PAY. AAWWK!! CRIME DOES
NOT PAY.
CHUCKLES all around. On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures
toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board:
ATTORNEY
Personally trained by my client.
INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are
milling around in the common area. T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb,
hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate,
MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES. BONIFACE
whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH
RAGE:
MR. BONIFACE
-- Where are my birds?!?
T-BONE
Shit, Pengy. I let 'em go.
MR. BONIFACE
Hermione. My canary. It's the dead of
winter!
T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR.
BONIFACE's profound distress.
T-BONE
They were all cooped up. With you leaving
and all -- seemed like the humane thing to
do.
BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell. He spots a
scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD. With
a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile...
MR. BONIFACE
I see. -- You might as well have this. I
won't be needing it...
He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on. The dim
strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the
earphones...
T-BONE
Well, thanks, Pengy. No hard feelings.
(chuckling to himself)
Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little
ass of yours.
T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset
on, grins from his bunk. TWO GUARDS arrive. As they escort
him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters:
MR. BONIFACE
You won't miss it long.
EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY
It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE
PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally
attired in cutaway and pin-stripes. He pauses to inhale a
deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of
exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading
his wings, REVELING in the cold.
A STRETCH LIMO pulls up. Two identically gaunt and vulture-
like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and
umbrellas, step out to meet him. These two gentlemen -- FRICK
and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and
""business managers.""
FRICK
Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.
PENGUIN
Mr. Frick. Mr. Frack. Our years of
planning are about to pay off.
INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY
Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning
to show. His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his
own ingenuity.
PENGUIN
I take it they found the money all right?
FRACK
We buried it exactly as you specified.
$42,271,009...
PENGUIN
How much have we got left?
FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET.
FRICK
Let's see -- an initial capitalization of
42 million and change, compounded over
thirteen years, at an annual return of
just under sixteen percent --
PENGUIN
Fine, fine. How much?
FRICK
Seventy-nine million. -- Excluding the
sum we buried.
THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a
normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK. He checks his watch and
reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE.
PENGUIN
Speaking of burials...
EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
T-BONE on work detail. He's got the Walkman on and he's
shoveling snow to the beat. He winces, and removes the
headphones...
The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie,
high-pitched WHINE. He's twisting the knob, trying to find
the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT
AT HIS HEAD.
T-BONE
HEY -- !
He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his
head. Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped
down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy.
He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a
frenzy. DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls,
SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him. He falls to the
ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like
rabbits, terrified...
By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard,
T-BONE's no longer even visible. There's just a swarming,
man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings
insanely. Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS
blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs.
All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's
mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard. A GUARD notices the
Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing
but ROCK MUSIC -- ""Surfin' Bird"" by the Trashmen. Bird bird
bird, bird is the word...
EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING
An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted
road leading away from the prison. It disappears from view --
and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great
squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as
he makes his way back to Gotham City.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out
on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy. She pulls
him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek.
VICKI
Guess what, Alfred. I think I found a
present for Bruce.
She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the
exterior wall. At first it doesn't want to fit through the
door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help
she gets it inside. The faithful butler stares curiously at
this odd-shaped gift...
VICKI (cont.)
Skis. -- Don't let on, okay?
ALFRED
He won't hear a word of it from me.
VICKI
He's such a nightmare to shop for. --
What do you get him year after year,
Alfred?
ALFRED
(conspiratorially)
I find you can't go wrong with
surveillance equipment. Let me put this
under the tree...
VICKI
Not so fast.
She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another
small gift. ALFRED stares at the tag -- ""TO ALFRED, LOVE
VICKI"" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN.
ALFRED
Why, Miss Vale -- !
VOICE FROM BEHIND
What's all this?
ALFRED and VICKI turn. It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner,
marching down the long stairway in the entry hall. VICKI
waves frantically.
VICKI
Don't look. It's your present.
VICKI rushes over to embrace him. He gapes at the long skinny
box --
BRUCE
What'd you get me? Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?
VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss. She nestles up against
him. WHISPERS in his ear:
VICKI
I'm going to give you the happiest
Christmas you've ever had.
Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED. Taking
the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one
end of the ski box. He backs out of the entry hall, dragging
the box before him...
CUT TO:
EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT
FIRES burn in garbage cans. TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy
landscape. Men, women, and children wander aimlessly,
huddling against the cold.
An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park. On
the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens,
half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a
candlelight VIGIL. Hand-lettered placards read: ""SAVE THE
PARK."" ""PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE."" ""THIS PARK IS OUR HOME.""
The source of the protest? A towering SIGN posted in a corner
of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new
luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw
Construction, Inc.
A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby...
INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the
demonstration.
VICKI
Homeless.
(beat)
I was just down here Tuesday. Seems like
there's more every day.
BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to
say.
VICKI (cont.)
Christmas time. And they say there's over
a thousand people living in the park
already.
BRUCE
-- Yeah.
The light changes. BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at
the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park.
EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to
Gotham's elite. A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has
been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of
PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as
BRUCE'S CAR pulls up.
A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in
concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush. The liveried
DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience
-- as they enter.
INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
Post-dinner. VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the
table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being
forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their
SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park.
VICKI
They're already razing the tenements and
SRO's downtown. These people don't have
anyplace else to go.
(beat)
If the city starts selling off the park...
BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings.
HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the
park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance...
BRUCE
-- Yeah. I guess I'll pass on dessert.
VICKI
(taking his hand)
Bruce, you do a lot more than most people
even dream of.
BRUCE
Sure. Comes off the top of my taxes --
VICKI
That's not what I meant.
They exchange a long silent look. Of course she's referring
to Batman. Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with
BRUCE.
BRUCE
-- What I ""do"" doesn't come close to the
root of the problem, Vicki.
(long pause)
I'm just a Band-Aid.
VOICE FROM BEHIND
Bruce! It's been ages!
VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder.
Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the
restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE.
BRUCE
Randall. You remember Vicki. -- How's
the construction business?
SHAW
The park tower? All systems go. If we
can get the junkies and winos cleared
out...
(a big grin)
Not too late to get in on the deal.
BRUCE
I'll think about it.
SHAW
Say, Walter Barrett's due back from
Europe. We should all get together at the
club.
(clapping him on the shoulder)
Nice to see you again, Miss Veal.
""Miss Veal"" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to
the next table. She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth:
VICKI
What a pig.
BRUCE
I've known him since he was seven years
old. He was a pig then too.
VICKI
Now he wants to gobble up the park...
(shivering)
Bruce -- isn't there something you can do
about people like that?
BRUCE
What, tie him up with a bat-rope?
VICKI
No, you idiot. I meant you. Bruce.
BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah. Subtle distinction.
INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT
BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant. He hands his
parking stub to a VALET. A crowd's beginning to form in the
lot outside...
The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short
distance off, near the entrance to the park. TWO RED BERETS,
in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged
WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS.
BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a
little closer -- within eavesdropping range:
RED BERET I
We were on patrol. Saw the whole thing.
JOGGER
I was attacked. Three men in ski masks --
COP I
(indicating the RED BERETS)
And these two broke it up?
JOGGER
These two?? They ran like rabbits. I
never saw anybody take off so --
RED BERET II
Hey! Somebody had to go for the cops.
COP II
You. SHUT UP, all right??
(to the JOGGER)
Lady, who was it that bailed you out??
JOGGER
A kid. Thirteen or fourteen tops. He
just came out of nowhere and -- tore into
'em.
(shaking her head)
It was so quick I didn't even see his
face.
Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who
responds with a mystified shrug. Her professional curiosity
piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER.
An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime
site:
RED BERET I
Dumb shit. Shouldn'ta been jogging in the
park at night anyway.
(sullenly)
Look around you. It's fulla bums.
BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he
passes.
BRUCE
Nice outfit.
RED BERET I
Piss off, geek.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT
Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor.
FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS --
totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the
sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank
leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar:
the WHARF RAT.
INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT
A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack.
The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving
up for their next tattoo. A TV over the bar is tuned to the
late news:
ANCHORWOMAN
...and tomorrow, the city's power elite
will be turning out in force to greet
millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett,
who returns to Gotham after a five-year
stay in Europe...
The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the
rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett. None,
that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who
gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner.
Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens
her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic,
vaguely Eurasian features. She's dark and elegant, fine-
boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know
it yet, is SELINA KYLE.
She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf
Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir. A LONGSHOREMAN
at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the
felt. Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she
finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene
indifference.
The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops. The
only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY,
who's still on the phone:
RICKY
Yo. Ricky here. What's the haps?
In mid-conversation he notices SELINA. She smiles invitingly
-- right at him. Mildly startled, he smiles back.
RICKY (cont.)
Midnight. No sweat. See you then.
He hangs up eagerly. Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up
his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar.
SELINA
Well. ""Ricky,"" is it?
RICKY
How'd you know that?
SELINA
I heard you on the phone. Talking to your
girlfriend.
RICKY
Girlfriend? No, no. That was business.
SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves.
SELINA
If you've got time for a little pleasure
...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.
She clasps his hand. His EYES BUG OUT. Three enormous rings,
a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks
on her left hand alone. RICKY gapes at the sparklers,
bedazzled.
RICKY
Jeez -- they look almost real.
SELINA
Why wouldn't they be?
RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought
is all too evident. He swallows hard and tries not to stare.
RICKY
You'd have to be crazy. Nobody'd wear the
real thing to a dive like this.
SELINA
Oh, they're real, all right. So are
these.
She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp
-- in front of his eyes. With lightning speed, before he can
react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick
stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand.
SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock. He tries to jerk
his hand away, but he can't break her grip. Then -- her
dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a
coy, Cheshire-cat smile.
SELINA (cont.)
Weren't we going to have a drink?
He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily. She takes his
wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at
the blood. RICKY is hypnotized.
She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow
-- intriguing. He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals
to the BARTENDER.
CUT TO:
EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT
Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are
icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost. A small STEAMBOAT
is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS --
mean, ugly, and heavily armed.
A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet
them on the dock below. The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT
RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank. Something major
is about to happen...
The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a
black MEDICAL BAG. Hands raised, the two of them start up the
gangplank.
Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on
the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies. One of them turns to
a colleague:
DOCK GOON I
Where's that goddam Ricky?
DOCK GOON II
Probably out gettin' laid. And here we
are freezin' our balls off...
EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's
bag. The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING
CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck.
BOAT THUG I
You pick.
The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random. Two BOAT THUGS tip
it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM --
revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER.
POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a
ramshackle boathouse at water's edge. Down on the deck of the
steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the
merchandise.
LIEUTENANT
It's pure.
REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof.
The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only
details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY
EARS...
CHIEF GOON (O.S.)
Let's do it.
He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH
assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT
THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to
the big hook.
BOAT THUG I
Hold it. Let's see the money.
Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase
and opens it. Lots of long green inside. The BOAT THUG
signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the
goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank.
LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT
The goon with the suitcase marches up. Beyond him, in the
distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof
and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the
CRANE.
ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone
holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck
and crane swings over the pier.
ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT
Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the
air.
ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down
onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath. The crates
explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and
random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic.
ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT
Nobody knows quite what's going on. Panicking, the GOON with
the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the
gangplank. BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick
shot. Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the
drink, suitcase and all.
Pandemonium. All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE. Thinking
he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON
and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range.
BOAT THUG I
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
(to another BOAT THUG)
Go after it. Get the money. GO!!
He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys --
diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire. Everyone's
ducking for cover. BOAT THUG I barks orders at the
pilothouse:
BOAT THUG I
Soltar las amarras! -- CAST OFF!!
ANOTHER BOAT THUG
LOOK!
BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE
landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away. Clad in inky
black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is
concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK. Studded, with
openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous
touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.
She bares her teeth and HISSES.
It's a woman.
BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized. In the time it takes
him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS. She
SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,
RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat. He slumps
to the deck, lifeless.
The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw
with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him
toppling into the water.
The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the
pier. She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the
DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the
boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.
Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky
specimens remain behind. She somersaults forward; takes one
goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off
the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more
reeling with swift talon-slashes. The whole frenzied mop-up
action takes just under ten seconds. Alone at last, she
stands back to survey the scene.
Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in
the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead. The snow
is speckled with red. A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in
their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down
and softly MOANING.
Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the
wreckage of the smashed shipping crates. BINDLES OF WHITE
POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all
about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested.
Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the
sides of the crates.
She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents
until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel. She opens
it carefully and holds it up for inspection. The statuette of
a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the
moonlight.
The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the
MOANING PUNK's back pocket. Then, cradling the raven under
one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet.
A LANTERN approaches. It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of
hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the
sight of the carnage on the docks. He kneels beside the
moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the
PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.
PUNK
Murcielago. MURCIELAGO!!
CUT TO:
INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT
The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with
the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them,
all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on
special perches mounted in the walls.
At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL.
ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a
wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water.
Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the
Gotham Zoological Gardens.
A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface. It's
not a whale; it's too pink. It is, instead, the PENGUIN --
and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK
standing in the open doorway.
FRICK
Mr. Boniface? Your...visitor has arrived.
PENGUIN
Thank you, Mr. Frick. Show her in.
The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool. Two of his
LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a
long chain, into place over his head. He grasps it with both
hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk
out of the water.
INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT
FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either
side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued
plumage. CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we
can't see her face, there must be something distinctively
feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and
fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she
strolls past.
FRICK opens a door and ushers her into...
INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room.
Her teeth begin to chatter. The big bay windows have been
thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's
freezing in here.
She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an
APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on
the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the
cold. He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the
back of SELINA's hand.
PENGUIN
Ah, Miss Kyle! At last we meet.
SELINA
At last we meet. -- Pigeons?
PENGUIN
Yes, they're common birds -- dirty,
stupid, unattractive -- but they're very
obedient, and they do crap on people's
heads. May I?
She extends a SHOPPING BAG. The PENGUIN removes a parcel and
unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE. He sets it on a
nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA.
PENGUIN (cont.)
I see your reputation was not exaggerated.
SELINA
I've located the others. All but one.
(shivering)
I'm surprised you don't catch
pneumonia -- !
With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut.
PENGUIN
My normal body temperature is ninety-two
degrees. Germs find me inhospitable.
SELINA
I see why they call you the Penguin.
PENGUIN
They may call me that...but rarely more
than once. Champagne?
She nods. He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a
toast.
PENGUIN (cont.)
My dear. Here's to the second biggest
crime in the history of Gotham City.
CUT TO:
INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in
darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room.
BULLOCK
It wasn't about the drugs. Whoever it was
left thirty kilos sitting on the docks.
They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a
terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story.
It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his
voice is audible over a concealed intercom:
JULIO (filter)
Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y
garras -- el demonio. El murcielago.
MURCIELAGO!
GORDON
What's that he keeps saying?
BULLOCK
""Murcielago."" -- Bat.
GORDON
Nonsense. That dock looked like a
slaughter-house. Batman's never committed
murder.
BULLOCK
We did find this in his back pocket.
BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD. It reads: ""THOSE WHO FEED ON THE
SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH"" -- and in lieu of a
signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom
corner.
While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in:
POLICEMAN
Commissioner? We've got Barrett.
INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
A cubicle down the hall. The splenetic WALTER BARRETT,
millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON
enters.
BARRETT
Fine welcome. These storm troopers of
yours dragged me away from my coming-home
party!
(beat)
I'd like to know the meaning of this --
GORDON
I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure
cocaine wound up concealed in your
personal effects.
BARRETT
Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest
and most influential familles in Gotham.
If you plan to accuse me of smuggling
drugs, be my guest.
(long, menacing pause)
I'll have your badge before you leave this
room.
GORDON weighs the threat. He nods to the COPS in
attendance...
GORDON
Book the son of a bitch.
GORDON storms out. BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the
COPS restrain him. Outraged, he bats their hands away...
BARRETT
I believe I'm still entitled to a phone
call.
CUT TO:
EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY
VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps. She's standing
behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown
DEMOLITION SITE. SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a
VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn
with rubble. The only structure still standing is a lone,
decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above
it, ready to strike.
A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE
COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION,
INC. Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and
hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE:
SHAW
Come on! Let's move it! We're an hour
behind as it is!!
A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the
tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION
GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the
condenmed building. VICKI watches angrily...
HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS
A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling,
clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave. Their few
belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which
the cops heave rudely out onto the street. Finally, the
handcuffs and nightsticks come out...
ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman
taking photos in the crowd. SHAW recognizes her instantly.
His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been
personally betrayed.
SHAW
Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!
He makes eye contact with her. VICKI stares back defiantly.
He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT
signals to him:
HARDHAT
Phone call, Mr. Shaw. Guy said it's
urgent.
SHAW
(to tbe SURVEYOR)
Hold the ball. I wanna hear it crash.
He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a
CELLULAR PHONE.
INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW
BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his
one phone call to contact the construction magnate.
BARRETT
It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett. I
want you to call my attorney. That was my
shipment they busted up last night.
SHAW
Jesus, Walter, I --
(suddenly puzzled)
Why are you calling me??
BARRETT
It's worse than that. Somebody took my
raven.
SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief.
ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT
SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a
daze. He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE
blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the
facade of the tenement.
SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it. He scurries off
to his car at the end of the block. VICKI, highly intrigued,
gets it all on film...
INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing
him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the
SQUATTER FAMILY.
SCHULTZ
Great stuff, but we're looking at a
shitfight with our beloved publisher. He
and Shaw...
(crossing his fingers)
Old money sticks together.
VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his
car.
VICKI
I'd sure like to know what shook him up
so. He was out of there like a scared
rabbit...
Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to
SCHULTZ's desk.
WILK
Got a blind tip from downtown. You know
that massacre on the docks? Batman.
VICKI reacts in astonishment. SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is
hot.
EDITOR
Whoa! Is this on the level?
WILK
Cops even got a note. ""Those who feed on
the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!""
(grinning; to VICKI)
Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a
notch.
VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING
ALFRED opens the door. A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the
face:
BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE
Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring
VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's
inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead.
VICKI
Seen the late edition?
ALFRED
I'm afraid so, Miss Vale. Master Bruce is
sequestered in the cave.
INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the
library. They pause in front of the television -- which is
tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot
issue of the day.
ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV)
Walter Barrett's no saint. His factories
have been dumping poison into the air and
water for years. If he is mixed up with
drugs...
PUNDIT (on TV)
That's not the issue. The issue is, do we
entrust our public safety to some...masked
vigilante. Does Batman have a license to
kill?
ALFRED
(shaking his head)
Ah, the public. Dishearteningly fickle.
VICKI follows ALFRED out. We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA
PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding
air time. He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT:
MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV)
Yo, here's the tip, man. Drug dealers are
scum. If Batman did wax these punks...SO
WHAT? They deserved it! End of
discussion.
INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING
ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep
quiet. He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER
GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker...
GORDON (O.S.; filter)
Anyone could've written that note.
INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT
GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS --
blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping.
CITY OFFICIAL I
And I suppose anyone could've taken out a
boatload of armed thugs. A dozen men, Jim
-- murdered in cold blood --
GORDON
Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds
of lives!
CITY OFFICIAL II
He's still a vigilante. We don't know who
he is, where he comes from, why he does
it...
CITY OFFICIAL I
Street punks are one thing, Jim. This is
Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of
mine!
As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a
COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner. We see the tiny TRADEMARK
embossed on the CPU -- ""WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES.""
INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE
as he LISTENS through his concealed bug.
CITY OFFCIAL II
You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least
for questioning. It would sure help if we
could get that mask off...
BRUCE shuts the recorder off. He turns to face ALFRED and
VICKI --
BRUCE
Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed.
CUT TO:
EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT
The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky. After a beat, the
CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point
and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past.
INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT
TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE
whizzes past on the street. The DRIVER pulls out behind it as
the second COP grabs his radio mike...
COP
One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview
north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat
10-78.
VOICE ON RADIO (filter)
10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37,
repeat 10-37. Backup on the way.
EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE
BARRELING TOWARD US on the street. The SQUAD CAR gains behind
it. A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash...
The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES.
OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS
As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO
MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the
pursuit. All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back
of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE
DRIVERS...
EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift
roadblock. ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them.
They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing
smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them...
ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself
from the body of the car. It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS
flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER.
EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK
A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES. The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING
UP and dive for the sidewalk. The COW-CATCHER slams into the
SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises
through the gap.
As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow
the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby
building --
EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
-- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot,
because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the
action with some dismay.
His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky
ground. He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL
UNIT:
BATMAN
Evasive.
SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in
thought.
CUT TO:
INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone. We're
in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction
magnate. There's obviously money to be made in real-estate
development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the
floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in
Gotham.
At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new
Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows. An
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back
to the camera...
WOMAN
It's a fake.
SHAW
Hmm. It cost me a half a million dollars.
You're sure?
WOMAN
Absolutely. You see, I...happen to know
where the real one is stashed.
The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed. He
seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the
moment, art is not the first thing on his mind. CAMERA STAYS
ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on
his mysterious guest.
SHAW
I guess you'd know. I have some ""friends""
in the art world. They say that -- for
certain hard-to-get items -- you're the
one to call.
WOMAN (O.S.)
How flattering.
SHAW
They say for the right price...you could
steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel
Wall.
WOMAN (O.S.)
Mr. Shaw. Do you believe everything you
hear?
SHAW
Oh, I'm not one to judge. I admire people
who take what they want. I'm just curious
how you do it.
SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her
face. It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of
the sofa...
SELINA
I find that the old methods work best.
Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat
smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep,
passionate kiss. Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW
drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine
across the polished parquet floor.
INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
The action's gone horizontal. SELINA, peeled down to a sheer
lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat
with quick, lapping kisses. She rolls off suddenly; when he
tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single
finger.
Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS,
twisting them around into tight cords. With a coy smile she
runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and
then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and
ties it off on the bedpost.
SHAW
Hey, what are you doing -- ?
He tries to break her grip. She BACKHANDS him sharply across
the face.
SELINA
You're very inquisitive. You'll just have
to be disciplined.
An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other
hand to the bedpost. None too quick, he's just caught on that
all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene. She crosses quickly
to the bathroom --
SHAW
You know, I've...I've never really done
this kind of thing before.
-- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems
perfectly appropriate in this context.
SELINA
I think people should indulge their
fantasies. Don't you?
Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches
into an oversized bag. She withdraws an odd-looking chromium
BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger. SIX-
INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place. SHAW's dopey smile
fades...
SHAW
Hey, what are those -- what are you --
He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS
away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby. A
SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically
pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we
CUT TO:
INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the
entrance of the building. Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show
various empty hallways throughout the building. He reaches
for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel
nearby.
INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT
The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a
BURGLAR ALARM. SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE --
concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on
hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of
complete exasperation: oh, shit. The GUARD'S VOICE crackles
over a nearby intercom:
GUARD (O.S.; filter)
Mr. Shaw? What's going on up there? --
Mr. Shaw?
Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts
a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on
the docks. She slams the door shut and swings the picture
back into place.
EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
SIRENS echo in the streets. SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and
streak off toward SHAW's building.
EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an
ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his
head. An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the
police frequency:
DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter)
-- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at
Gotham Park West. Move out. It's Randall
Shaw. Repeat, all units --
BATMAN's eyes widen. He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY
METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as
part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo.
But it's no umbrella. When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his
BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding
-- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS.
He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS
THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise
past far below.
INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
There's an awful BANGING at the front door. SHAW lies under
the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the
ceiling. SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings
a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders. She picks up the
nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and
clambers out onto the ledge outside.
Ten seconds later the COPS burst in. They rush to the bedroom
-- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the
bed --
-- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall.
Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT.
COP
JESUS!
EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT
Forty stories up. The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she
scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one
lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF. She scampers across the
rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle,
like a mountain climber --
-- until she reaches the building at the end of the block.
Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack. She pulls out a
retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around,
HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street...
EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally
oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the
small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in
black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the
intersection.
EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT
The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides
she's out of danger. Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops
to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches,
emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure. She's just
made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped
for a moment of Quality Time.
She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over. Her whole
body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes
dart left.
A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line.
The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest
of seconds before he steps back into the shadows. She acts
like she hasn't noticed...
...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same.
TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT
His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her. If it's
possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're
seeing it now.
HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT
She still doesn't let on that she's seen him. Instead, she
goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a
gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little
private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE
ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit.
EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
His jaw is down around his knees. Whoa. He edges forward
slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her...
She hears a noise. Stops. Makes a big show of looking left
and right. Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN
jumps back into the shadows. She gathers her things; a small
WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and
she VANISHES over the edge.
Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in
time to see --
EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building,
flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master
gymnast. Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS
-- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect
landing on the roof of a passing BUS.
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD. He
kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled
upon it...
LOOKING FOR LOVE?
He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment. He rushes back to the
edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the
entrance to Gotham Park. He's reaching for his grappling-gun,
figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the
face.
EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the
rooftops. Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as
he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view.
COP
Hey. You see what I saw...?
This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios. Right
on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up. LT. BULLOCK,
who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out.
BULLOCK
It's Randall Shaw. Torn to ribbons. --
We just made Batman up on the roof.
GORDON
Oh God.
EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park. A BLACK
SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing
among the branches...
We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving
finally at:
EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT
The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks
and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park
Towers. MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest
nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift
soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches.
VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand. She's
trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken.
VICKI
Please, just one. It's important for
people to see what's happening.
HOMELESS MAN
They don't want to see us, lady. They
just want us gone -- out of sight, and out
of mind.
(mumbling as he wanders off)
Get worse before it gets better. It
always does.
VICKI TURNS. In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and
wailing. A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and
a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd.
All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE
IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables,
RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos.
Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run. Those who resist meet with
swift and sudden violence. A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and
gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble.
VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come. She
backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS
FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film.
A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --
sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the
snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.
He points her out to a colleague...
...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with
pure cold malice in their eyes. VICKI turns to run, but it's
slow going in the snow. She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers
are almost upon her...
...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES
one of the HARDHATS. The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to
the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.
The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON. But the
FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the
way. As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his
head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow
from the second guy's tire iron.
In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's
belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the
tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets
to his feet. He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING
the iron --
-- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-
KICKS HIM in the face. HOP; KICK. HOP; KICK. The FIGURE has
nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit
the ground.
The FIGURE turns toward VICKI. Her eyes go wide with
astonishment.
It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,
grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT. She stares at
him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the
aid of his fellow homeless...
She can't believe what she's seeing. The KID wades smack into
the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass --
spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display
of pure athleticism. It seems like he's everywhere at once.
There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle
himself like this...
Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch
bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide
turns. The invasion is being repelled. Faced with renewed
resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and
race off to their VAN.
Triumph in shantytown. The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster
together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that
everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the
trees.
But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead. As the KID
runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --
TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow. The KID
throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at
him...
CLANG. The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,
BOARDLIKE. The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there
with a baseball bat.
He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his
feet -- thanks for returning the favor. He's about to light
out again when --
VICKI
WAIT! Don't be afraid. I wanted to thank
you. I --
KID
(cautiously)
Twenty.
VICKI
What?
KID
Twenty bucks.
VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just
the same. She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID
snatches the bill out of her hands. They stare at each other
for a long moment --
VICKI
...Who are you?
KID
Dick.
-- and then he's bounding off like a shot. VAULTING up into a
tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches. VICKI starts to
follow, but there's no way she can keep up. Instead she digs
into her CAMERA BAG...
HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS
Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the
treetops. She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks
of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from
limb to limb...
For a moment it seems like she's lost him. As she sweeps the
lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of
an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance. She ups the
magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal. The
stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE
-- BRUCE's great-grandfather.
As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet
from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again. He
looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then
races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small
hillocks, over a frozen creek.
There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter,
mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate
and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place
behind him. Home sweet home.
EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT
as she lowers the lens. Her face is full of conflicting
emotions. She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find
out what his story is. But on the other hand -- even the
homeless are entitled to their privacy...
CUT TO:
INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT
A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed
from a nearby chair. The cat arches its back -- waits -- and
SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair. The canary
SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor,
cradles it in her arms...
WOMAN'S VOICE
Now Hecate. You don't want that scrawny
little bird --
It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black
ensemble. At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his
customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN. He
bares his teeth:
PENGUIN
Do you want me to wring that creature's
neck?
SELINA
You try it, I'll do the same to you.
(as he grumbles; bemused)
I saw him, you know.
PENGUIN
Saw who?
SELINA
Batman. He was dreamy.
She strokes the cat, in a reverie. The PENGUIN drops his
polishing cloth, startled.
PENGUIN
Dreamy?!? Are you insane!? My God --
(sputtering wildly)
Are you sure it was him? What did he do?
SELINA
He stood on a roof and watched me. He
didn't realize I'd seen him. I don't
think he knew quite what to make of me.
(smiling)
But he was definitely interested.
This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing. (Or
waddling.)
PENGUIN
This scheme of yours is backfiring. We
don't need him on our tails. Do you know
how much money is at stake here?
SELINA
Money isn't everything.
(casually)
What's the point if we can't enjoy
ourselves?
She chuckles to herself. He stares at her in disbelief -- and
SQUAWKS.
CUT TO:
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING
The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9
shopping days left until Christmas. Down below, BRUCE is
walking VICKI to work.
VICKI
Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then
vanished into a drainage pipe -- right
next to the statue of General Wayne.
BRUCE
My illustrious great-grandfather. Think
it's the same kid we heard about?
VICKI
Must be. He reminded me of you.
BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe
building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM:
NEW BAT-MURDER?
Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer
Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment
The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY
RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall. BRUCE scowls at VICKI:
BRUCE
-- You work for this rag?
(snatching up a paper)
Your boss is calling for Gordon's
resignation -- unless he brings Batman in
for questioning...
VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the
street.
THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP
The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his
Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS. A MOTHER drags
her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells
heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't
approve...
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI
looking on in dismay. BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage:
BRUCE
I need a good PR man.
NEWS VENDOR
Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'?
With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack.
VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe.
VICKI
That's what happens when you go after the
rich and powerful.
BRUCE
Hey, it wasn't me, remember? I am rich
and powerful --
As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand. He sees
an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- ""LOOKING FOR LOVE? Find
it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS.""
Looking for Love. Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a
quarter and races back to the newsstand. VICKI keeps
walking...
VICKI
Maybe it's almost...good. In a weird way.
I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people
like that were really scared, maybe
they'd --
She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself. She turns
around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly
unfolding a copy of the Globe. She marches back and tugs at
his sleeve.
VICKI (cont.)
Hey, I'm late for work. You can read that
later.
BRUCE
Quiet. I'm looking for a personal ad.
Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the
page.
BRUCE (cont.)
""Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on
the roof 12/16. I was in black; you were
too.""
VICKI
Is this some kind of bad joke?
BRUCE
It's her. That cat woman, or whatever she
is.
(reading aloud)
""I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping
you'd follow, but you were too shy...""
VICKI
What does she want -- a date?
BRUCE
She's trying to contact me. Says she's
gonna leave me another ad...
The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity. BRUCE's
mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that
makes VICKI just a trifle nervous...
INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY
VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down. She
spots a message in the ""in"" file. She takes one look at it,
and her eyes go wide with RAGE. She storms out in a fury...
INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY
Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the
inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe.
He's just opening his mail. He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI
BARKS at him:
VICKI
WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY?
PROVOST
Close the door.
(waiting for her to calm down)
Your story isn't news. With Shaw dead --
VICKI
But the project's still going ahead! If
attacking homeless people in the park
isn't news, I'd like to know what is --
PROVOST
There's a psycho out there in a mask and
cape -- killing off Gotham's most
prominent citizens! That's news.
(beat)
I've known Randall Shaw all my life. His
family is in mourning. And it just so
happens I don't believe in slandering the
dead.
VICKI FUMES. She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the
eye.
VICKI
Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have
tied up in the Park Tower project?
PROVOST
Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that
remark. For the sake of your job, I
suggest you do the same.
VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail. He
finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with
the word ""CONFIDENTIAL"" underlined three times in ink. He
tears it open --
-- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents:
a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM...
THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM
WILL SUFFER MY WRATH
CUT TO:
EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY
WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of
the courthouse. BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS.
REPORTER I
Mr. Barrett! Any comment on the
arraignment?
REPORTER II
Is it true bail was set at two million
dollars?
ATTORNEY
Stand back! My client has nothing to say
at this time!
The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a
waiting CAR, shielding his face. REPORTERS cluster around
it...
As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS
taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall
of Justice.
OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR
PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is
idling at a traffic light far below.
INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT
The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the
light to change. BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his
cellular phone.
BARRETT
It's time we called an emergency meeting
of the Raven Society. Get back to me...
Looking troubled, he hangs up. A fat white glob of PIGEON
SHIT splatters across the windshield. Seconds later --
another SPLAT.
BARRETT (cont.)
Damn pigeons.
DRIVER
Just washed it, too.
The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch. They hear a tiny
DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield.
BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look. A small,
blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade
assembly...
OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR
Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million
fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the
intersection.
CUT TO:
INT. BATCAVE - DAY
TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the
intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of
BARRETT's car. BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears
behind him.
ALFRED
The Fluegelheim called again, sir. They
want to know if you'll be attending the
opening of the new Egyptian exhibit.
BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED
off.
BRUCE
Cancel.
ANCHORWOMAN (on TV)
-- and, citing new evidence in the so-
called string of ""millionaire murders,""
Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today
swore out a warrant for the arrest of
Batman.
(beat)
We go now live to Mike Sekowsky,
spokesperson, Order of the Bat.
SEKOWSKY
Jeez! Talk about gratitude -- !!
At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in
disgust. ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of
the Batcave.
BRUCE
Well, Alfred, it's official. I'm a wanted
man.
(beat)
""New evidence""...I've gotta find that
woman. Did you check the personals?
As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds. They've got a
visitor. BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees
COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron
gates of Wayne Manor.
He throws a nervous look at ALFRED. ALFRED speaks into a
microphone:
ALFRED
Who's there?
GORDON
Jim Gordon, Alfred. I've got to see
Bruce.
A spooky development. Does GORDON suspect? After a moment's
hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in.
ALFRED
Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.
INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER
A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures
toward the liquor cabinet. The Commissioner nods his head no.
He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be
here.
GORDON
Sorry to bother you. Bruce -- I'll get
right down to it. You knew Shaw and
Barrett --
BRUCE
I saw them occasionally. We all sat on
the board of the Fluegelheim...
GORDON
Did you have any...dealings with them,
or --
BRUCE
No. I never liked the way they did
business.
GORDON
The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped
together in the public mind -- the Five
Families of Gotham, that sort of thing --
and, uh...
(taking a card from his pocket)
Harrison Provost got this in the mail.
BRUCE examines the card, -- ""THOSE WHO FEED,"" etc. He stares
at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest...
BRUCE
Then Batman is behind all this.
GORDON
Batman or a damned good imitation.
BRUCE
Well. He's changed tactics, hasn't he.
GORDON
(shrugging; at a loss)
Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a
druglord, major polluter -- they weren't
exactly model citizens. Who knows, it
could be some crazy social-conscience kind
of thing.
BRUCE
You mean he's going after...the root of
the problem.
GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go. BRUCE hands him the
card.
GORDON
Let me know if you get one of these.
We'll put all our resources at your
disposal.
BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the
Commissioner out. A moment later, the butler reappears.
BRUCE
Changed my mind, Alfred. I'll be dropping
in on the Fluegelheim after all.
CUT TO:
INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT
It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian
exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping. BOARD MEMBERS,
MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets
and evening gowns, making small talk. AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has
been set up as a wet bar.
On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall,
rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE.
The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and
reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains,
statuary and all.
Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the
goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of
a pointy-eared CAT. She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four
tiny KITTENS romp at her feet. BRUCE, who's just arrived, is
taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess...
VICKI
What is it?
BRUCE
I just had a weird sense of deja vu.
He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the
publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate --
the remaining member of Gotham's ""Five Families."" The two of
them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't
quite make out...
TIPTREE
Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce.
We owe him that much.
BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them.
PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of
nonchalance.
PROVOST (cont.)
The man's a space cadet. Let him look out
for himself.
(as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully)
Why, Bruce! What a delightful surprise.
BRUCE
Good to see you two. Looks like the Five
Families are suddenly down to three.
(looking around)
In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on
this room right now --
TIPTREE chuckles nervously. PROVOST is even less amused.
PROVOST
Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?
BRUCE
Not at all. Commissioner Gordon seems to
think we should all be hiring bodyguards.
TIPTREE PROVOST
Oh, that's absurd. I already have.
The two of them glower at each other. It's like an outtake
from The Newlywed Game. BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a
vacuous face:
BRUCE
Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would
be after us. Can you?
PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of
hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party. It's
SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing
dress slit up to the armpits. She's holding two glasses of
CHAMPAGNE...
SELINA
You two look like you need a drink. --
And is this who I think it is?
She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery
SMILE. He BLINKS, temporarily speechless.
PROVOST
Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne.
SELINA
Our absentee board member! I've been
wanting to meet you forever.
TIPTREE
Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities.
She brought the Temple over block by
block --
SELINA
You two won't be terribly upset if I
borrow Bruce for a moment, will you?
Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and
dragged him off. A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his
eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY. His tongue is practically
hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check. SELINA
SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE:
SELINA (cont.)
Major contributor. -- I always seem to
wind up in charge of fund-raising...
BRUCE
I can't imagine why.
SELINA
Tax year's almost over, you know. I hope
we can count on your usual generous
donation.
(indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE)
Someone's got to set an example for those
two tightwads.
BRUCE
They're proccupied. This string of
murders --
SELINA
I asked them if they'd consider including
us in their wills.
(chuckling to herself)
They didn't seem a bit amused...
ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT
She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and
their overdressed WIVES. She glances across the room at the
statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE. A frown
crosses her face...
ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT
She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the
statue.
SELINA
-- and this is my good friend Bastet, the
Egyptian Cat Goddess.
BRUCE
I think we've already met. -- This is
quite an expedition you've put together.
SELINA
I'm glad you think so. I have to say,
Bruce -- you're not at all what I
expected.
BRUCE
Sorry to disappoint you.
SELINA
Oh, it's not that. Not at all. It's just
that I'd always heard you were...
BRUCE
What?
SELINA
(coyly)
Oh...sort of a...
BRUCE
(smiling; fascinated)
No. Come on. What?
BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered
when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially --
takes his other arm. The women exchange big, toothy, plastic
smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting
for him to introduce them.
BRUCE
Oh. Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.
SELINA
The photographer. I've seen your pictures
in the Gazette.
VICKI
The Globe.
SELINA
Oh, that's right. The tabloid one. --
What an original dress!
VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE. He senses
trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass.
BRUCE
Selina supervised the reconstruction of
the temple. Brought it back from Egypt...
stone by stone.
VICKI
Really. She must be awfully tired.
(to SELINA)
How'd you get to be in charge of a huge
project like this?
SELINA
It was easy. I slept with the Pharoah.
She laughs at her own joke. VICKI responds with a dry little
chuckle of her own. SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the
sleeve.
SELINA (cont.)
Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart? We have
some boring museum business to talk about.
VICKI fumes. BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him
off out of earshot.
SELINA (cont.)
I. Short leash.
BRUCE
Pull in the claws, okay? She's really
terrific.
SELINA
I'm sorry, Bruce. Sometimes I get a
little...aggressive, you know?
(handing him a card)
Look, I need to talk to you. Come by
sometime. I'll give you the private tour.
BRUCE
Wait. Let me explain about Vicki --
SELINA
(shushing him)
I understand. Anyone who's that
protective must have a pretty good reason
for it.
She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial,
unmistakably juicy. Then she's off in pursuit of another
major funder. BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in
his hands when VICKI rejoins him.
VICKI
How's ""business""?
BRUCE
Relax, okay? I like you better.
He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE. No
luck.
VICKI
If you're looking for your fellow
millionaires, they left some time back.
CUT TO:
INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
The roof of the Gotham Globe. A STARLING circles overhead for
a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT.
INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT
TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office.
Brass letters on the door read ""J. HARRISON PROVOST,
PUBLISHER.""
INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT
PROVOST, agitated, working late. He speaks, sotto voce, into
the phone:
PROVOST
Don't worry about that. I've had the
office swept for bugs. No one's
listening...
INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
TIPTREE in his paneled study at home. There's an open bottle
on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard. His
VOICE QUAVERS:
TIPTREE
It's just so -- unfair. I mean...it was
over a century ago. It's not like we're
responsible.
(hollow-eyed)
How could he know? How could Batman know
about the Raven Society??
INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT
PROVOST
Who knows and who cares. The point is,
it's happened...
He hears a CHIRP and looks up. It seems to be coming from a
HEATING VENT on the wall. But then it stops, so he resumes
his conversation --
PROVOST (cont.)
I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm
taking the raven with me. I suggest you
do the same.
INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT
In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny
BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft. Now
that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY
PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE
taped to its leg.
PROVOST (O.S.)
I'll tell you how to reach me. And don't
repeat this to anyone.
CUT TO:
INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY
The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool. He's wearing
rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his
arctic birds. The vents in the windows are open, and the
climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in
fur, stroking her pet cat:
SELINA
He's just another rich idiot.
(chuckling to herself)
The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit
concerned.
PENGUIN
Then he is an idiot.
SELINA
He lives in some big sprawling manor.
I'll have to get inside, scope it out...
see where he's got the raven stashed.
PENGUIN
How do you plan to do that?
SELINA
How do you think!
A feline smile from SELINA. The PENGUIN chuckles to himself,
lobs a FISH out over the pool. A swooping GULL snatches it
out of the air before it hits the water. FRICK arrives in the
doorway.
FRICK
It's Mr. Provost, sir. He's planning to
embark on an unscheduled Christmas
vacation.
PENGUIN
Good! That should save us a trip to the
bank.
CUT TO:
INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY
A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk:
archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a
healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over. This
is SELINA's private domain. CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case
full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens...
BRUCE
What have we got here?
SELINA
Mummified cats. Bastet's sacred animal.
They were buried by the thousands at
Bubastis. -- Oh, careful!
BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen
JARS. Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape,
jackal, man, falcon.
SELINA (cont.)
Canopic jars. In the process of
mummification, the internal organs were
buried separately.
(pointing to each jar in turn)
Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine --
BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder.
BRUCE
You're in a gruesome line of work.
SELINA
Keeps me interested. And that's not easy
to do...
BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd
beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON.
BRUCE
This one I know. It's a gryphon, right?
SELINA
Very good. A mythical demon, half-bird,
half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to
deliver retribution and justice.
BRUCE nods. He can dig it. He regards the gryphon for a long
moment and CHUCKLES.
BRUCE
Poor guy. Birds and cats -- you wouldn't
think the two halves would cooperate.
SELINA
Only under certain circumstances.
(beat)
I'm really glad you came, Bruce. I was
afraid I'd given you the wrong impression.
Or maybe it was the right impression.
BRUCE
What was it you wanted to talk to me
about?
SELINA
Your collection. I'd love to see it. I
mean, everyone says you've got a
fabulous --
She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself. She toys
demurely with her equipment. She looks up at BRUCE and
switches tactics -- going for the direct approach. BRUCE
braces himself...
SELINA (cont.)
Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you
again. Does she know you're here --
Vicki?
BRUCE
(shrugging)
No.
SELINA
It must be strange. Having all that
power, and money -- never really knowing
if that's what people are attracted to.
BRUCE
What are you attracted to?
SELINA
I think you're a little bit nuts.
(beat)
I think you're a little -- bored with your
life. Having everything you want. No
variety, no...danger. And every once in a
while you need to take a risk. Shake it
all up.
BRUCE
How?
SELINA
Maybe by...coming here today.
She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips. She's
letting him have it with both barrels.
SELINA (cont.)
That's one thing I can give you, Bruce --
danger -- a little something you can't get
at home.
BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible. He moves
forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly
closer...
...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE. She backs off in shock as he
covers his face. His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING.
She rushes over --
SELINA
Are you okay?
BRUCE
Is there a cat in here?
Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW
-- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg. He brushes the
animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms. BRUCE sniffles
uncontrollably.
BRUCE (cont.)
Get it away!
She drops the cat, which scampers off. BRUCE rubs his eyes.
SELINA
Poor thing. You're allergic!
BRUCE
Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid...
(snorting and weeping)
Look, I'd better get some fresh air.
Maybe another time, okay...
He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him. He's gone,
but she knows she's left a dent in his armor. She smiles in
bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS.
EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated.
He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he
stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE.
He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been
waiting for:
TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming.
Why don't we trim the tree together?
This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street.
In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN
are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost
fifty feet tall.
The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham. BRUCE
smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to
his car.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT
SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree. The
tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the
ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric
sheets.
A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in
front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition
of ""God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen."" The Square is rocking with
good will toward men. When they get to the part about saving
us all from Satan's power --
EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
-- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from
his usual gargoyle's perch. He's scanning the streets and the
rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move --
whatever it is.
He glances at the building directly across the square from
him. On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in
ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL
SCULPTURE of the world turning. His eyes rove downward along
the facade of the building...
EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT
At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the
Globe offices. THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of
the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX
handcuffed to his wrist. Of course, we can't see what's
inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just
about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE.
The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without
incident. As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the
frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which
reads:
BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE?
Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE!
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
He watches with some curiosity. An armored car: is this some
part of the CATWOMAN's scheme? But no...the GUARDS are safely
inside the building, and the CAR is leaving. He settles back
to wait.
INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT
The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe
building. FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and
the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the
windshield.
They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of
similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS. Just part of the
fleet...
INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office.
The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy
getaway. The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX --
sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at
arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents.
Satisfied, he slams it shut. He reaches into his top drawer
for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY.
PROVOST
Open this in an hour. Phone my wife and
tell her where to meet me.
(to the GUARDS; edgily)
No trouble on the way, I take it?
LEAD GUARD
No sir, Mr. Provost. We came straight
from the bank vault.
GUARD II
'Copter should be just touching down.
We'll have you safely out of here in no
time.
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
""Here Comes Santa Claus"" echoes up from the streets. BATMAN
watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of
the Globe...
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER
PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an
elevator bank. The other GUARDS head for a stairwell.
GUARD II
We'll check the stairs. See you on the
roof.
The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST
pulls a key from his pocket instead:
PROVOST
No -- my private elevator. It's safer.
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
shooting DOWN on the car as it rises. The shaft above it is
filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like,
swooping and gliding among the gears and cables...
EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT
In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors
still spinning. In FG, the small dormer-like structure that
houses the STAIRWAY. The metal access door opens, and the
first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready. He
smiles back at his pal.
GUARD
No way. They don't pay us enough to
tangle with Batm--
A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of
the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT...
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up
button and the car begins to rise. Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO
OUT. The car stops with a lurch.
PROVOST
What is it?? What's happening??
Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud
POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire...
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD
singing ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" at the top of their lungs.
Happy faces beam. No one hears anything unusual over the
music...
EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN
BATMAN straining to listen. We get another faint series of
POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the
loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades.
He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all. He scans
the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's
happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon
sign...
EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire
from the dead GUARD's rifle. The helicopter is still idling,
but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with
stiffs...
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
PITCH BLACK. Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue
from the darkness. An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the
emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a
corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed
spastic. The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points
up at the LIGHT:
GUARD
There. Mr. Provost. See? The
generator's kicked in. It's just an
electrical problem.
PROVOST is only marginally consoled. They hear a strange
TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them...
PROVOST starts babbling again. The GUARD slaps him across the
face. But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well. He
stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on
the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move.
GUARD
There. See? It's moving. We're fine.
PROVOST
It's going down. We're going DOWN!!!
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR.
They're patiently riding it down as it descends...
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
The car stops again. PROVOST is totally losing it. The
exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM.
GUARD
Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look
through the trap door. But I need you to
help me. Okay? You have to help.
PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself. The GUARD
looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car. He can't
reach it...
He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist
-- and STANDS on it. Still short. Unholstering his gun and
using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door. He
JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the
panel slightly.
More TWITTERING. PROVOST and the guard look up through the
tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.
GUARD
Probably just some bird that's gotten in
the shaft. Now calm down. You'll have to
give me a boost.
The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box. PROVOST gives him a
boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap
door.
GUARD (cont.)
Okay, help me out...steady...
PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and
tries to hoist him upward.
INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT
From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the
GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door. Now
his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls
himself upward.
He peers around. His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight
-- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front
of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face...
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling.
PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees.
All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and
his legs KICK WILDLY. Still PROVOST struggles to hang on --
even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome...
Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much. PROVOST
trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his
ass in a corner of the car. The GUARD tumbles in a heap to
the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond
recognition, his eyes gone altogether.
PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS. He peers at the open
trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and
SHRIEKS AGAIN.
The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings. He stares at it. It rings
again. Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage,
PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver.
PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
Sixteenth floor. Linens, housewares,
ladies' lingerie!
PROVOST
W-who is this??
INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT
NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all
driverless. FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical
equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been
LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's
private elevator, the doors to which are still closed. The
PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.
PENGUIN
Mr. Provost? If you want to get out of
that car alive, I suggest you follow my
instructions to the letter.
As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on
the concrete nearby, DEAD. A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been
lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper
production staff from the VAN POOL. They're trapped on the
other side. BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door...
PENGUIN (cont.)
SHUT UP IN THERE.
(calmly; into phone)
You should see a cord hanging just behind
you.
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned
CORD descending through the trap door.
PROVOST
Yes -- yes, I see it --
PENGUIN (V.O; filter)
Tie the cord to the handle of your box.
PROVOST lets the phone drop. He grits his teeth, but hastens
to obey. As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the
box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him
into a panic. Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.
PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
When you're done, I want you to give two
sharp yanks on the cord.
Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it
twice.
PROVOST
Who are you?? Why are you doing this??
INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN
Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and
BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear. FRICK climbs
into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine.
PENGUIN
Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call
me an irate reader. And to be perfectly
frank -- I'm doing this because I hate
Garfield.
Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the
mouthpiece of the phone.
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT
A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver. All at once, the
elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging
themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined
space.
PROVOST is screaming like a madman. The birds are in his
hair, his face -- everywhere. He fights his way over to the
panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy...
All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD. It's as if the floor
has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL.
INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN
PENGUIN
Going down!
He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from
the ELEVATOR DOORS.
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets
uncontrollably downward. A steady stream ot BIRDS are making
a quick exit from the trap door in the roof...
INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT
The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the
dormer that leads to the roof. She pries open a pair of
ELEVATOR DOORS...
...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making
for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above. She reaches
inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it
in.
She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at
her trophy. It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like
the first two. An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down,
RATTLES THE SHAFT...
She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the
roof.
EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN
He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight
from the Globe roof across the square. Something weird is
definitely going on. He's about to abandon his post --
-- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING. The
big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the
seconds:
CROWD
Ten! Nine!...
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND
A ramshackle kiosk at street level. The NEWS VENDOR has
stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities.
A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the ""BATMAN -- HERO OR
MENACE?"" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of
papers on the curb.
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE
EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off:
CROWD
...Three! Two! One!
The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into
CHEERS. The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of
""JINGLE BELLS.""
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND
The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone
else when a second newspaper van rumbles past...
NEWS VENDOR
Hey! No! I aleady got a --
He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing
RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS. They shove a BODY out the door --
The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk
with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read
""BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE.""
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING
The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded
a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square.
The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence --
-- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID,
CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!!
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE
The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop
down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders.
ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the
BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant
Christmas tree.
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS
CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES.
They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as
the bats attack. WOMEN SCREAM. CHILDREN SCREAM. MEN SCREAM
TOO.
A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands
on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA
CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a
prerecorded voice: ""HO HO HO."" The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as
the BATS converge on him.
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT
HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour
in through the broken window. WOMEN lined up for a FREE
MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their
hairdos.
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN
He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below. He
glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a
WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at
the chaos, TAUNTING him.
EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
A few blocks away from Gotham Square. SIRENS HOWL. There's a
steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the
disturbance. One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction,
against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN.
EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER
BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the
CORPSES strewn across the helipad. A dying GUARD raises a
shaky hand...
BATMAN crouches beside him. A GURGLE comes up from his throat
and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips. All at once he
hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE
SCULPTURE...
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Some people just can't take discipline.
(beat)
Go ahead. Finish 'em off...
His head jerks up. He can't see anything. A sudden WHOOSHING
noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the
roof.
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
You might as well. You're going to get
blamed for it anyway.
He stands. He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW
springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof,
clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures. He reaches for a
Batarang.
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Oh, come on, angel. You know you want to.
(purring loudly)
Besides -- I want to see how you do it!
BATMAN
Who are you?
He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind,
feet first, knocking him to the rooftop. He tries to get up,
but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS,
knocking him back into a cornice. He ducks right just as a
SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three
inches from his throat.
He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and
lands on her feet. Cats always do...
CATWOMAN
My, aren't we frisky tonight.
He flings the BATARANG. It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as
she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach. GLASS TUBING
shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows --
CATWOMAN
I should tell you -- I've got nine lives
to play with -- and you've only got one...
He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a
death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly
toward the HELICOPTER. The huge ROTOR BLADES are still
turning...
BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free --
FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof. It's a strategic move: when
he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and
KICKS UPWARD with startling force.
This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his
feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER.
He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on
him.
She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around
his CROTCH. He tries to break her grip, but she's just as
strong as he is. And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward,
toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the
helicopter!
The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises
perilously closer. At the last possible instant, he grabs a
handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can --
With a YOWL, she releases him. They tumble to the roof and
she DIVES ATOP HIM. Her TALONS click into place -- he sees
them poised directly above his EYES --
-- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can
strike. Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and
circle each other...
SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the
roof, trying to break it down. BATMAN turns for an instant --
a sudden CRACK --
-- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT-
O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER. She
sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he
collapses to the roof in a jittering heap. The BANGING on the
door is louder...
CATWOMAN
Did I tell you I invited company? -- Keep
'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.
She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching
face. Then she scurries to the edge of the roof,
DISAPPEARING --
-- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes
crashing out onto the roof!
Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but
the COPS are swarming the place. They spot the BODIES on the
tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the
obvious conclusion. Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE. BULLETS
RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE.
BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a
GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which
is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS
HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall. The SWAT COPS score a
couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum,
but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough
to reach the roof.
CUT TO:
INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in
the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door.
Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all
the ruckus --
-- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining
fast. Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his
UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS
A TRIGGER.
ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges
itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR.
INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin
HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS. A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS
bounce off in rapid succession. CRACKS begin to spread across
the glass.
The COPS can't see where they're driving. The car SWERVES
WILDLY. And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE
WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW...
EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT
The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a
LAMPPOST and SKIDS. The second car CRASHES INTO IT. And the
pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto
the immobilized squad cars.
INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT
The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off
unmolested.
PENGUIN
Look at that, boys -- they do flock
together!!
CUT TO:
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK
continues. COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies
as they try to evacuate the citizenry. PARAMEDICS drop the
stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their
heads...
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof
over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow. The
roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for
step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the
next, leading him on. Finally she reaches the edge of a
building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go
but down. She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to
him --
CATWOMAN
Ooh. Where have you been all my life?
He edges closer. Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY
OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.
BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING. He hesitates a second -- moves
closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE.
BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT
Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade
of the building some ten or twelve feet below. The window of
a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping
in the chill wind.
EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment.
BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop
to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way
down. A sudden CRACK --
The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment. Instead, she's
followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently
doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN. He TURNS just as
her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg. She gives it a
sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER
THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.
EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN
He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS
UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING. The WHIP
has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding
tight. He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away
from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip
UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.
He manages to brace his left foot against the wall. It's a
massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from
moving. The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down
to the pavement...
EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT
She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed
pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place. With a cheshire-
cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it
on the edge of the cornice.
EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT
BATMAN hanging immobile. Craning his neck, he can just see
the
RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly,
and apparently talking to him...
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Nevermore. Nevermore!
Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice,
chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a
fern bar.
CATWOMAN
Cute, huh! I think it'll look nice over
the fireplace. Maybe you can drop by and
see it sometime.
(demurely)
I hope you won't think I'm too...
aggressive or anything, but I find you
very attractive.
She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat
with a piece of yarn. BATMAN grimaces. She speaks in a low,
soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr. Behind the bondage
mask she bats her eyelashes.
CATWOMAN (cont.)
It's just so hard to meet interesting men
these days. Don't you think so?
(sighing)
I have trouble with relationships. Men
find me intimidating...kind of predatory,
you know? Really I'm not. Really I'm
just playful...
BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can
grab hold of the whip. She frowns and YANKS on it. His foot
flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils
before he can stabilize himself.
CATWOMAN (cont.)
Don't laugh! I'm trying to open up to
you!
Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut
him loose.
ANGLE ON BATMAN
He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt.
Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around
into firing position. He'll shoot it right through her if he
has to...
CATWOMAN (cont.)
I always seem to fall for the wrong guys.
You know...most men are rats.
ANGLE ON CATWOMAN
She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her
philosphical mode.
CATWOMAN
Mice, really. It's disgusting -- they beg
you to walk all over them and then they
whine when you do it. Once you've had
your fun there's not much you can do but
kill them.
(beat)
But you seem different. I mean, you
obviously understand about dressing up...
that saves a lot of explaining. I think
people should indulge their fantasies,
don't you?
BATMAN is sweating profusely. He can't hold his position much
longer. And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation
out endlessly...
CATWOMAN
So I think I'll let you live. Cute boys
like you are hard to find...
(standing up)
'Bye, angel. I'll be thinking about you.
And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with
her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle. He hangs there a moment,
tries to twist himself around without moving his foot. He
braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his
grappling gun and FIRES.
The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof. BATMAN yanks the line
taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when --
-- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice!
CATWOMAN
Gee...I'm so fickle.
A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly
SEVERED. BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's
still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN. He DROPS eight or ten
feet...
EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN
watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to
DISLODGE. It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof
and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the
CORNICE --
-- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY. Fascinated, the
CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down...
ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS
He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up
toward him. He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS
CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch. The rods in his
cape begin to INFLATE...
Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge.
Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS.
Four stories up, he rights himself. Three stories up, he goes
into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide
arcs over the street...
...and a moment later there are no stories left. With an ugly
crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES.
Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the
middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION.
EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two
feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD. He doesn't move. PEDESTRIANS
are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and
peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the
street:
DRIVER
What the hell is this?
CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few
blocks over. HORNS are honking. A TRAFFIC COP marches
over --
TRAFFIC COP
Awright, what's the problem here?
(spotting BATMAN)
Jesus.
He tries to clear the crowd away. A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is
forming around the prostrate BATMAN. The COP blows his
whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN
rush up to join him.
They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.
The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body
armor. Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters...
PATROLMAN
Good God. Cowan -- get to the car --
radio the commissioner!!
By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection,
all surging forward to get a look. More COPS are arriving to
beat them back.
TRAFFIC COP
Is he dead? What do we do?
PATROLMAN
The mask. Get the mask off.
They hunker down over BATMAN. One of them tugs at his mask --
but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way. He feels
around --
TRAFFIC COP
Some kinda seam here on the neck...
The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like
fastening under BATMAN's chin. The instant it comes open --
-- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS
in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,
shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.
Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced.
One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.
On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN. The
body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --
TRAFFIC COP
DON'T SHOOT, you idiot. The crowd --
Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the
ONLOOKING COP's hand. BATMAN is back among the living.
SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing
out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --
Fuck the crowd. TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire
in absolute panic. BATMAN slams backward into the delivery
truck and crumples to the ground. As he falls, he grabs a
couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the
pavement.
Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading
through the intersection. BATMAN emerges into the midst of
the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --
EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT
A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam,
drawn by all the confusion. He rears the horse back, turns it
in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute
the incoming cars...
Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms. He
looks down. He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden
JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.
BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over
to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of
the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE. He digs in his heels,
maneuvering through traffic...
EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks
off trying to get through the jam. Their siren is on, but the
cars blocking their path have no room to pull over. BULLOCK
grabs the radio mike:
BULLOCK
Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner.
We'll have to go in on foot...
As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in
the opposite direction. On the back of the horse...is BATMAN.
Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car
immediately into REVERSE. As they watch, BATMAN kicks the
horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park.
INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night
patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to
the park.
RED BERET I
This is wack, man. Nothing ever happens
around here anymore.
The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his
partner out of the way. They tumble into a snowdrift as
BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and
gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process. By now,
SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park...
INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER
SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP
CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the
park. BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white
whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than
twenty yards away.
He turns the horse in a circle. MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the
distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered
from the opposite side of the park. It's going to be tough
getting out of here...
Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather,
GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet
apart. He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI
and gets an inspiration.
He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans
the little frozen creek. There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL
VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate. This must
be where the boy vigilante holes up...
He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's
saddle and sends it off with a slap. He pries the grate loose
and crawls inside.
INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT
A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in
the floor.
RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN
passes directly underneath. A little farther back there's an
ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train
tracks below.
Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy
vigilante's stash. The first contains tins of food, plus
various odds and ends. The second's more in line with what he
needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING.
A TRAIN rumbles past underneath. BRUCE removes his COWL and
sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get
him out of the park. A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten
topcoat: perfect. As he's pulling them out of the box, he
spies something extremely odd --
It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT
with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine
condition. He removes it carefully from the box and holds it
up in front of him. Stitched on the vest is a single initial,
""R,"" in a black circle. He stares at the whole mystifying
ensemble in complete befuddlement...
The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING
NOISE. Someone's in the tunnel with him. He lowers the
costume abruptly --
-- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front
of him not three feet away. The kid's just crawled up through
the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder
messing with his stuff:
DICK
It's MINE!
He lunges furiously at BRUCE. The two of them tumble back
into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE --
EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds
before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling.
BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment. DICK lands
hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked
smile comes to his face...
Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent. The body
armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and
above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view...
As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the
bridge. Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange
little boy's hands.
The kid sizes up the situation immediately. He nods his head
up and down. Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws
it to BRUCE.
BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth. He
pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and
starts to move off.
DICK
NO. WAIT!
BRUCE turns, uncertainly. DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP.
The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably. Then he sprints off
into the woods, dancing, leaping. As he disappears from view,
he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK --
-- which is obviously intended to divert the cops. BRUCE
makes haste in the opposite direction.
EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER
BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape
still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it.
INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
TWO COPS scanning the park. The CAPED HORSE charges past in
front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the
headlights. From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in
the saddle.
The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn. A moment later, he
SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the
squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen
ski cap, obviously one of the homeless. A COP leans on the
horn and shouts out the window:
COP
Dumb son of a bitch!!
The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path.
The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse.
CUT TO:
INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN
A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table. ALFRED, in robe
and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE
BANDAGE.
ALFRED
Commissioner Gordon called. He wants to
install a full contingent of police guards
here at the manor -- in round-the-clock
shifts -- to protect you from Batman.
BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair. His shirt
is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a
full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS.
BRUCE
Great. What'd you tell him?
ALFRED
I told him that since you were Batman,
you'd require no protection from Batman.
BRUCE makes a face: how droll. ALFRED tears off the tape with
a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF
PAIN.
BRUCE
Jesus, Alfred -- !!
ALFRED
In future, sir...I strongly advise against
trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.
BRUCE
It's just a few bruises.
ALFRED
One bruise, sir. Which covers your entire
body.
BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly
fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's
bag.
BRUCE
I'm getting too old for this line of work.
(beat)
Cops placed me at the scene of the crime
-- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my
face --
ALFRED
I shouldn't worry overmuch. I doubt the
two of you move in the same circles.
BRUCE
-- and I got the living shit knocked out
of me by a woman.
ALFRED
Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are
quite unbecoming.
INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY
In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side
(or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS
settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across
antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS
littering the carpet. HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one
wall.
They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE
across the street...
HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT
A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping
watch on the roof of the brownstone. He signals ""all clear""
to his counterpart watching from the house opposite.
INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT
TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block,
munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone. They
spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on
his way to the brownstone. One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks
up his RADIO MIKE:
PLAINCLOTHESMAN
Mailman's coming.
EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER
The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone,
sorting through letters and packages. He hasn't even rung the
bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches
the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS
FACE.
INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT
MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside --
unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up. They're in
for the long haul.
The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of
COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown
paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS. They carry it
gingerly into the kitchen. Into the midst of all this
bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON:
GORDON
Anything suspicious!
In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are
examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light
bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open.
COP
Nothing yet. Christmas cards and bills.
He anxiously watches their progress. A VOICE calls from the
kitchen.
BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.)
Commissioner -- ?
INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER
GORDON enters. The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment
scattered all over the kitchen table. They've slit the brown-
paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE
TIN.
BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT
It's a fruitcake.
He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look.
GORDON
...Have it analyzed.
INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying
a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES. His WIFE and TWO KIDS are
behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an
extended vacation.
POLICEMAN
Mrs. Tiptree? The car's here.
TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long
wordless moment. Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's
sleeve.
LITTLE GIRL
I don't wanna go to Grandma's. I wanna
stay here with Daddy.
MRS. TIPTREE
She's got a nice tree just like ours,
honey. Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.
LITTLE GIRL
She's old. She doesn't even have cable.
LITTLE BOY
What about our presents?
He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the
parlor.
TIPTREE
Don't worry. I'll bring 'em up with me.
We'll open 'em when I get there.
TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids. He CLUTCHES his wife's
hand.
GORDON
Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.
MRS. TIPTREE
Kids? Tell your Daddy goodbye...
Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort
MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door. TIPTREE pulls GORDON
aside.
TIPTREE
They'll be safe, won't they?
GORDON
As safe as we can make 'em.
(beat; sternly)
It would help if you could give us some
small hint what this is all about.
TIPTREE
I told you. I...
TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes. GORDON is
convinced he's holding something back.
GORDON
You have no idea what was in that box that
Provost had delivered from the bank.
TIPTREE shakes his head wearily. GORDON glowers as he turns
to go.
GORDON (cont.)
All right, Mr. Tiptree. Merry Christmas.
GORDON exits. TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living
room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids
ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS. One of the COPS tries to
pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move...
...until a PHONE RINGS. Everyone jumps at once. A TECHNICIAN
hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly,
then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver...
TIPTREE
Hello...?
VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER
Mr. Tiptree? Andy here. Listen -- we've
got a chance to grab a good-sized block of
Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an
eighth --
The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment.
TIPTREE
Not today, Andy. Let's talk after New
Year's.
TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle
of the room. The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment
as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff
jolt.
INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY
Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary
composing a LETTER. He takes a long pull on a glass of
Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an
envelope. He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a
.38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes
it to the envelope. He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE.
A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK.
He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the
ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.
He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside,
onto the sill. The bird, well-trained, struggles only
slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes
a FOLDED NOTE. Scrawled across it is a handwritten message:
IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD
He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing.
CUT TO:
INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY
BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions. A BANNER
HEAD-LINE shrieks:
BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER
Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square
J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy
He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall. He gets up...
INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY
BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing
her patetented thing on ALFRED.
SELINA
English accents are so stimulating.
(beat)
You have the most beautiful silver hair!
ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR. He's
about to break into a sweat. He's eminently relieved when she
turns and sees --
SELINA (cont.)
Bruce!
BRUCE
Selina. What are you doing here?
ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA
slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm. She's on him like a
barnacle.
SELINA
I wanted to see your things, remember?
And I got tired of waiting for you to call
me back.
(gesturing toward ALFRED)
He's adorable. How long have you had him?
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory. He glances
back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around
the corner.
BRUCE
You heard about Harry Provost.
SELINA
It's incredibly awful. It got me a little
worried.
(sidling up closer)
I hate to think of something happening to
you.
BRUCE
Same here.
SELINA
It's odd, though. Danger, the thought of
suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets
you sort of...aroused. Don't you think?
BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her. Everything gets her sort of
aroused.
INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER
SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and
exotic weapons. She's like a kid in a toy shop.
SELINA
Bruce, this is incredible.
(indicating a suit of armor)
Malaysian -- ?
BRUCE
Not bad. Sarawak warrior caste.
SELINA
It's like -- everything in here is another
little piece of your mind. I was right
about you.
(turning to face him)
Promise, okay? Promise you'll show me
every inch of this place.
PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer
printout. He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at
a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the
keyboard.
ALFRED
The police have no files whatsoever on
Selina Kyle.
BRUCE
(abstractedly)
London...Cairo...Belgium...
ALFRED
What exactly are you --
BRUCE
Her credit card records.
(looking up)
Every major art theft in the last five
years -- she's been on the scene or close
to it.
ALFRED
You mean she's some sort of -- collector?
A...cat burglar, or --
BRUCE
Could be. Museum curator, authenticator
-- she's got the perfect cover for it.
(beat)
What would she want with that stupid
raven?
ALFRED
Raven, sir?
BRUCE
That's what the Catwoman took from
Provost. A little raven statuette, about
so big...
(shaking his head)
But it couldn't have been that valuable.
He continues to scan the screen. ALFRED is suddenly lost in
thought.
ALFRED
How very odd.
(long pause)
I'm sure it's nothing, but --
BRUCE
What, Alfred?
ALFRED
Your father had a raven, sir. A small
statue of the very sort you describe. It
used to sit on his desk.
This piques BRUCE's interest. He swivels around in his chair
and stares directly up at ALFRED.
BRUCE
What happened to it?
ALFRED
After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree
came to the house and asked if he could
have it. As a keepsake. I saw no harm...
(shrugging)
That was thirty years ago.
BRUCE
Wait a minute. Mr. Tiptree?
ALFRED
George Tiptree. Your friend Elliott's
father.
CUT TO:
INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed. It's empty
-- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's
stuffing inside it. His head turns suddenly at the sound of
the doorbell...
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister
into the ENTRYWAY below. Standing there is an unexpected
visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a
battery of COPS pat him down.
BRUCE
What are you looking for -- Batarangs?
TIPTREE
Bruce! Come on up.
(to the COPS)
I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.
The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs.
INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER
TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him.
BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX.
BRUCE
I brought you a Christmas present. Sorry
about the wrapping -- the police made me
open it.
TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE
CLASP. He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of
bewilderment and gratitude. BRUCE nods for him to try it on,
and he obliges...
TIPTREE
...I'm afraid I don't have anything for
you.
BRUCE
I think you may have something that
belonged to my father.
TIPTREE
-- You know?
He stares at BRUCE, astonished. His head sinks into his
hands.
TIPTREE (cont.)
It'll all be over tomorrow. One way or
another, it'll all be over.
(looking up; despondent)
I've decided, Bruce. I'm gonna give him
the last two ravens. He's already got the
others.
BRUCE
What are you talking about? Who?
TIPTREE
Batman. I don't know how he found out,
but --
TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a
drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands.
BRUCE
It's time you told me what's going on
here.
TIPTREE
Didn't you ever wonder where it came from,
Bruce? All the privilege, all the power
...all the money?
(beat)
The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce.
The key to an incredibly vast fortune.
BRUCE
Whose fortune?
TIPTREE
Gotham City's.
FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham. A massive
EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and
total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming,
POLICE rushing to the scene...
TIPTREE
In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was
looted. It was a fantastic operation --
perfect military precision. The robbers
made off with milllons in gold and silver
bullion...
A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens
around a corner. Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a
GATLING GUN into the crowd. POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to
the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the
wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite
direction.
FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth,
arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS
-- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER
WAYNE.
TIPTREE (V.O.)
The city was going under. Bankrupt...
until five rich men stepped in to bail it
out. In exchange they took the land
rights, the mineral rights, the service
contracts --
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE
BRUCE
The Five Families.
TIPTREE
Our ancestors. They bought Gotham City --
carved it up and ran it into the ground.
In five years they were rich beyond
imagining.
(pause)
We've just been following in their
footsteps. And in all this time no one's
ever suspected --
BRUCE
-- that they were the ones behind the
robbery?
FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)
The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne
Manor, raising a celebratory toast. CAMERA PANS OVER to a
nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES.
TIPTREE (O.S.)
They had five ravens made. Five ravens
which -- combined -- would reveal the
location of the treasure they'd stolen.
(beat)
But they never touched it. They never
needed to. It's still there to this day.
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE
TIPTREE
The ravens, and the secret -- have been
passed down through generations. Father
to son...
(shaking his head)
Your father -- died before he could tell
you.
BRUCE
So they stole his piece of the puzzle.
TIPTREE
Yeah. I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going
to hand it over. He's right, you know.
We've all been feeding -- feeding on the
soul of Gotham...
BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced. There's one part of the
story that doesn't quite add up.
BRUCE (cont.)
I don't believe you, Elliott. My father
was a decent man -- an honorable man. He
would never have taken part in a scheme
like this.
TIPTREE
It wasn't his doing, Bruce. It was --
BRUCE
That doesn't matter. If he knew that his
fortune was based on a crime -- a crime
against the city...
(violently)
Reputation or not, he would've tried to --
TIPTREE
Christ, Bruce! Do you want me to spell it
out for you?!?
BRUCE backs off. An awful shiver of anticipation runs down
his spine.
TIPTREE (cont.)
He was a decent man. He was an honorable
man. That's why they had him killed.
CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a
SERIES OF SHOTS
Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a
MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace. THOMAS WAYNE
lunging at him. The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS.
PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk. A second
bullet felling his MOTHER --
-- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN
and GRIEF --
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
-- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the
adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years
later. Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as
TIPTREE finishes his tale.
TIPTREE
They killed him...to protect their secret
...and now the bill's come due. Now the
bill's come due.
CUT TO:
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK
The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and
beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against
the setting sun. A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past...
INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
BRUCE lies motionless on his bed. Scattered about him are
SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS
which describe the murder of his parents. Disoriented, he
gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no
longer seem quite so familiar...
He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at
the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is
crushing him down. Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS. He makes no
move to answer it.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK
VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee. ALFRED, who's
in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone.
ALFRED
Thank you, yes, everything's fine. I'll
expect your next call in an hour.
(hanging up; to VICKI)
The police are becoming an awful nuisance.
VICKI
I feel so awful for him, Alfred. There
must be something we can do.
ALFRED
I realized long ago -- that there are
places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one
will ever penetrate -- or share.
(pause)
He loves you, Miss Vale. But in certain
ways he will always be alone.
BRUCE (O.S.)
...Thanks for the testimonial.
ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring
at him. He starts to say something, but thinks better of it.
He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down
across from VICKI. She extends a hand and he takes it --
making a visible effort to hold himself together.
BRUCE
Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous
with 'Batman.' I think Batman ought to be
there when it happens.
ALFRED
I see, sir. When shall we expect you
back?
BRUCE
Get your cap. You're driving.
INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently
downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE. The lights are on
in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching
TV.
INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness. TIPTREE kneels
beside the tree and digs around among the packages. He pulls
out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed ""TO DADDY -- FROM
SANTA.""
With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the
package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN
STATUETTES. He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then
slinks into the hallway...
INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown
Christmas special on a portable TV. One of them glances out
the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the
brownstone, SUITCASE in hand...
STAKEOUT COP I
Shit -- that's Tiptree!!
The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE.
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of
the brownstone.
COP
Mr. Tiptree! What the hell are you --
HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine.
TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone
follow suit. At the end of the block he vanishes down a
SUBWAY ENTRANCE.
INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT
A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS
come racing down the stairs. The COPS trip over his open
violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor.
They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE
TURNSTILE --
-- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling
down a stairway which leads to the train platform below.
INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER
TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN. The doors slide shut
behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as
he rolls off.
COP
We've gotta get back to the radio.
INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING
TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively.
Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice
in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the
sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing. Derelicts,
prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well-
heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his
suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor...
An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car. It's a
DEAFMUTE. He shambles down the aisle passing out little white
CARDS. One side is a guide to International Sign Language.
The other reads:
DEAF AND DUMB
PLEASE HELP -- $1.00
TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling,
shining the DEAFMUTE on. A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type,
stuffs a buck in his tin cup. He reaches TIPTREE and extends
a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact --
-- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face.
Now TIPTREE looks up. THIS CARD bears a personalized message:
GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION
B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW
TIPTREE's eyes widen. The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK --
glowers down and holds out his cup. TIPTREE digs in his
pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands
it over anyway.
Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next
car. TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card. He fidgets
with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier...
INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT
TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE. A small BLIP
moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen.
BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently.
ALFRED's up front, at the wheel.
BRUCE
According to this, he's directly below us.
ALFRED
The subway, sir?
BRUCE
Yeah. Take a right.
INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT
It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham. TIPTREE
emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS
thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as
they scan the crowd.
Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the
nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold
the SUITCASE out of view.
INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER
TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to
close. He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the
doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT. He stands
there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the
train lurches forward...
False alarm. The train stops, and the doors hiss open again.
INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER
TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations.
As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful
STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious
suitcase. He sits there panting...
Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car. TIPTREE does a
take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line!
Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin --
FRACK...
WIPE TO:
INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE
debarks at a deserted local stop. The station is EMPTY except
for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a
WOMAN in a long fur coat.
TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell,
STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor. There's something
familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed
hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face.
It is, of course, SELINA...
TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting
further instructions. They aren't long in coming. A BLACK
MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform,
and STRUTS in front of him.
MYNAH
FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK! FOLLOW ME.
The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE
TUNNEL. TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief. Then the bird
CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of
the tunnel:
MYNAH (O.S.)
FOLLOW ME. AWWWKK!
TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping
awkwardly to the tracks below. Suitcase in hand, he begins to
walk...
INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT
ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer.
BRUCE
He's slowed down. Looks like he's under
the park.
ALFRED
How do you propose to get down there, sir?
We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a
token.
BRUCE
I know another way in.
(beat)
Step on it. They're down there waiting
for him.
ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past
the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse...
INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT
A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen. When it passes,
we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express
tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with
each step. It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the
only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot
intervals.
He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly
switches to the local tracks. The train rumbles past with a
deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his
surroundings. TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the
tunnel...
...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a
small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE. They've set up camp down
here in the tunnels, away from the elements. Surrounded by
bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap
wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with
the suitcase who's invaded their domain.
TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening
down the tunnel. The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with
one exception. A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty
topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively
as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows.
His face is familiar. It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the
park.
INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER
In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be
working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible. When he
comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of
the bird's shrill voice to guide him:
MYNAH
AWWRRK! FOLLOW ME.
TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. He trips on
the tracks and drops the suitcase. As he's getting to his
feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE...
VOICE
STOP THERE.
The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches
on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE. TIPTREE COWERS and
SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands
before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA.
TIPTREE
I've cooperated. I've done everything you
said.
PENGUIN
Open the case.
TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase.
A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness.
PENGUIN (cont.)
...Two ravens?
TIPTREE
The other one is Bruce Wayne's.
(trembling)
He doesn't know anything about this.
You've got what you want. There's no need
to --
PENGUIN
Thank you, Mr. Tiptree. You may go.
TIPTREE stands. He backs away from the suitcase warily.
TIPTREE
My family. You won't --
PENGUIN
We'll certainly take your unexpected
generosity into consideration.
TIPTREE
We -- ?!?
(shielding his eyes)
You're not Batman.
PENGUIN
No. I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman.
Now move out.
INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT
TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA,
silhouetted in the flashlight beam. The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY
as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light
down --
-- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel
cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING
as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath.
INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE
looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross-
girder. He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat,
WHIRLS SUDDENLY --
-- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS
at the PENGUIN. The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella --
which happens to be a bulletproof job. The PENGUIN lifts his
brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft --
-- and TIPTREE staggers backward. SHOT IN THE CHEST. He
spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the
ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of
sparks.
The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the
tracks. The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for
signs of life.
CATWOMAN
That idiot. Another six feet --
PENGUIN
So sorry to spoil your fun. -- He brought
two ravens. We've got a complete set!
CATWOMAN
What??
PENGUIN
Yeah! They're in the suitcase --
An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel. They see the lights of a
TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're
standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across. The
PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track,
where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag
TIPTREE out of the train's path...
CATWOMAN
GIVE ME A HAND!
They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the
train arrives. They stand against the outer wall, waiting for
the train to pass...
...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante --
standing on the inner track directly across from them.
HOLDING THE SUITCASE. The kid takes off like a shot. The
CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter
disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK.
INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK
The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress. He looks back
over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has
fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast.
PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY
INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK
watching in the light from the train as the two costumed
figures grapple in the distance. He races back toward the
scene of the melee...
INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT
...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for
blow. He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook,
and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding. She lifts a
hand: no mas...
He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track. Before
he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN
approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the
last one. He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out
of its path...
...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN
comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite
direction! Now he's got trains approaching on either side,
and there's no place to go --
The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet. He LUNGES at
her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer
tunnel wall.
INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT
The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and
the CATWOMAN from view. The CENTER train is bearing down
fast. A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches
the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on
the innermost LOCAL TRACK.
He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite
directions. He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead...
INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT
BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove --
there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the
passing TRAIN. She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and
CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT.
HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT. As they struggle,
she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER...
It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved
him when he fell off the roof. But this time the results are
altogether different. He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS
CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF
THE TUNNEL.
His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against
the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the
rearmost car --
-- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED
OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train!
INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK
He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively
to see what's become of BATMAN. Finally the center train
passes --
-- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE --
smiling at him -- advancing menacingly. DICK TURNS TO RUN...
A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps
to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of
the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.
The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat. The CATWOMAN
snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him. She
peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated...
CATWOMAN
God. Did you see him? Isn't he hot?
PENGUIN
Haven't you got anything else to think
about?
(mopping sweat from his brow)
I'm hot. That was exhausting.
CATWOMAN
No pain, no gain! -- Suck it up. We're
not out of here yet.
She sprints off down the tracks. SQUAWKING, he waddles along
behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him...
As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back --
past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding
heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF
TUNNELS --
-- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he
staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody. He scans
the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his
gaze falls on DICK.
He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his
head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all
around him...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT
The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT. CAMERA
ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL...
INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome. We TILT
DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie
sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT.
The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the
atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a
point directly under the dome. There, encased in a plexiglass
case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City
Hall was erected. He shouts up:
PENGUIN
LETS DO IT!
INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT
The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony.
Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical
interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the
pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a
bronze bust. The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families...
The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly. She removes the FIVE
RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way
around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed
bases. She follows along behind them, replacing each bust
with a RAVEN.
When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up:
PENGUIN
Now. Give each raven a quarter-turn.
His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its
recessed socket, in quick succession...
INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN
The moment of maximum tension. He stands there frothing at
the mouth with anticipation. SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing
happens.
CATWOMAN
What happens now?
PENGUIN
I don't know. That's all...!
He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him
from above. He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen
next. Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the
floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING,
flapping his arms like wings.
PENGUIN (cont.)
We've been TRICKED! It's a HOAX! It's
a --
He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK. Somewhere
behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind. He spins
and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass
case...
The city model is TREMBLING slightly. As he watches, the DOME
of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model
city -- POPS OFF on a hinge. A METAL STRONGBOX rises into
view...
INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT
The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal
box. The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass
case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to
get at the box.
FRICK
That's the treasure?
CATWOMAN
No. It's a map...
She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER.
INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN
The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls
through, landing atop Gotham City. He snatches at the
strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a
colossus. He's climbing down off the tabletop when the
CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him.
He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off
the box. He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a
MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS. The CATWOMAN creeps
over to his side:
PENGUIN
Bruce Wayne. So he doesn't know a thing
about the treasure, eh...?
(handing her the map)
Look at this. It's right under Wayne
Manor. It's been there all along!
Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS. They show
progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES --
an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION...
PENGUIN (cont.)
Looks like some kind of cave.
FADE THROUGH TO:
INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK. He lies unconscious in a big soft
frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp
cloth; he moans slightly...
His eyes snap open suddenly. He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a
yelp.
VICKI
No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're
hurt.
He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway. His
shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling. The pajamas he's
wearing are three sizes too large. He paces about, staring at
his unfamiliar surroundings.
VICKI (cont.)
It's all right. You're safe. You can
stay here as long as you need to.
DICK
I don't belong here. You can't keep me
here.
Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades,
looks out at the grounds.
VICKI
It's ""Dick"", isn't it? Or do you prefer
""Richard""?
He stares at her as if she's nuts. VICKI opens a closet door:
all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including
the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the ""R"" insigne on the
breast.
VICKI
""R"" -- for Richard, right? See, all your
things are here...
(staring at the costume)
What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?
DICK
It's none of your business. What is this,
some kind of home?
VICKI
No, not that kind. There's a swimming
pool -- tennis court -- you can have
anything you want.
DICK
Tennis court?! -- Lady, you're rich. How
the hell would you know what I want?
VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder. He bats it
away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in
agitation --
DICK
I'm not staying. You can't make me --
-- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him.
BRUCE
I can make you.
DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized
him. The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh. I'm
in Batman's house.
BRUCE (cont.)
Come on. Wanna go at it?
(no response)
Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my
guest -- and long as you're here you might
as well enjoy it.
ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a
bedside table. DICK edges toward it and sits down. He waits
for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE
all the while.
BRUCE (cont.)
Will you two be okay in here?
VICKI nods yes. BRUCE backs out of the room.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY
BRUCE pulls the door shut. ALFRED follows him down the hall.
ALFRED
What do you propose to do with him, sir?
Keep him in the room for the rest of his
life?
BRUCE
I don't know, Alfred. I've got other
stuff to worry about.
ALFRED
The child is hurt, sir. At the very least
we should attempt to locate his parents.
BRUCE
He hasn't got any parents.
ALFRED
How do you know that, sir?
BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze.
BRUCE
...I know.
The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway.
ALFRED picks up a hallway extension. He covers the
mouthpiece:
ALFRED
Sir -- it's Miss Kyle.
BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call.
INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY
ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room. A
SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a
phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over
her.
SELINA
Well! Tall, dark and handsome. Are we
still on for tonight?
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE
He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED. On his
look we
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT
Christmas carols playing. VICKI's got DICK helping her trim
the tree.
INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA.
ALFRED
Is this necessary, sir? After all...it is
Christmas eve.
BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT. He empties the contents
of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE
CAPSULES. He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits
them in his jacket pocket.
BRUCE
Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a
cat.
ALFRED
I don't like to see you going out on a
date...unprotected, sir.
BRUCE
She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for
me.
(turning to go)
It's the only way, Alfred. I've got to
take her out tonight.
INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV)
DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the
bottom of the stairs. The two of them exchange a few brief
words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly
sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door.
VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of
cheer as DICK turns discreetly away. This is one weird
household he's landed in...
INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT
SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front
of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in
her own reflection. She's looking especially sultry tonight
in a glittering low-cut gown. She lowers one shoulder strap
and strikes a pose in the mirror: better. She runs a hand
through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look.
The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to
answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which
means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand.
BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in. She pulls
up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly:
SELINA
You're early. I'm afraid I'm not quite
dressed.
BRUCE enters and takes a long look around. It's a big open
loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts.
The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS. The
finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised
platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it,
yowling at BRUCE. SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out.
SELINA (cont.)
If you're looking for my bondage gear,
it's at the cleaners.
BRUCE
Christmas eve. No tree?
SELINA
No presents. I've been a bad girl this
year.
BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby
wet bar.
BRUCE
I'm surprised you kept this date. I
thought you would've lost interest by now.
SELINA
What makes you say that?
BRUCE
You've got what you want, don't you?
SELINA
I do now.
(smiling)
We've had this date for a long, long time.
With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in
to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss. But BRUCE seems
strangely unresponsive. She breaks free and gives him a funny
look.
BRUCE
How much is it going to cost me?
SELINA
What?
BRUCE
...To get the ravens back.
He watches her closely for a reaction. SELINA's shocked, but
she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion.
SELINA
You're the oddest man I've ever met.
(moving in on him)
Let's talk later, Bruce. I've got kind of
a short fuse...
BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a
crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek. She works her way
downward, kissing him around his neck and throat...
HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket. He withdraws a tiny
GLASSINE CAPSULE. But before he can use it --
He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away. His free hand goes
to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from
between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS. She's bitten him...
Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and
massages it gently with one hand.
SELINA
Did I hurt you? Just relax -- you'll
start to enjoy it.
BRUCE pulls away again. His eyes are strangely glazed. He
tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen.
SELINA (cont.)
Bruce, you look faint. It must be the
cats.
BRUCE stands suddenly. It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo
nightmare. His legs give way beneath him and he topples to
the floor, INERT. His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls
out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem
to work.
SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form --
purring and stretching...
BRUCE'S POV
A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory
smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus.
BRUCE
What di-- what did you d--
She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright
red.
SELINA
I guess I've...gotten under your skin.
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes
SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG.
He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually
going slack.
The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and
stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING...
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT
A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on
schedule.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT
ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's
boys.
ALFRED
Everything's fine, thank you. We'll talk
in an hour.
Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE. She's curled up on
the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious
glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven
o'clock.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall. He's got
all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a
window and throws the bundle outside.
There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from
the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make
it. He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS.
INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her
Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and
FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious
and stone limp. The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates
of Wayne Manor.
PENGUIN
Try his mag card.
FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED
CAPSULES.
FRICK
Look at this. He's a pillhead.
Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an
electronic device at the edge of the drive. The gates
magically part. There's a large VAN just behind the car --
driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS. Both vehicles
pull in before the gates slide shut.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER
VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen
announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival. She heaves a huge
sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open.
She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up.
VICKI
Ohh. Am I glad to --
To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the
floor, flat as a board. VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters,
throwing his arms wide.
PENGUIN
MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!!
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch. He lets go and
drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding
again. As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER
coming from around the house.
He races over to peer around the corner. He sees the two cars
out front. He sees the last of the goon squad barging in
through the front door.
His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window.
In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI
surrounded by gun-toting intruders. One of them grabs her and
twists her arm behind her back.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT
VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE.
VICKI
What did you do to him??
SELINA gives her a catty little smile.
SELINA
First-time jitters, I guess. Everything
was going great, and then...he just went
limp as a noodle.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY
Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the
entry hall, pulling a robe around him. He freezes in his
tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front
parlor, holding a gun to her head.
PENGUIN
You'd be the butler. Why don't you come
on down and attend to your guests?
ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him. He
marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate
form.
ALFRED
Mr. Wayne. Is he -- ?
PENGUIN
You know how it is. Some guys just can't
hold their egg nog.
INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER
The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's
already assembled. FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa
just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE
inside.
PENGUIN
I should explain the occasion of our
visit. There's a treasure underneath this
house -- and I don't plan to leave until
you tell me how to find it. Now who's
going to talk -- Miss Vale?
VICKI
I don't know what you're talking about.
PENGUIN
The cave. Under the house. How do I get
there?
The PENGUIN gestures. FRICK holds the gun to her head.
VICKI (cont.)
I don't know! I swear, I would tell
you --
PENGUIN
(turning to ALFRED)
Then maybe you'd like to tell me.
ALFRED
You're no more than a common thief.
PENGUIN
Wrong, you old idiot. I happen to be a
very uncommon thief.
(beat)
Are you going to tell me, or does Miss
Vale get an early present this year?
FRICK cocks the gun. VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans
the room, weighing his options. Trembling, he shuts his
eyes --
ALFRED
I...don't...know...
PENGUIN
Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the
tree.
FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger. VICKI winces. ALFRED
starts to blurt something out. But a split-second before he
can speak --
SELINA
Wait!
(crossing over to VICKI)
We don't know how to get down there yet.
We may need her when Bruce wakes up.
The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off. ALFRED and VICKI heave
simultaneous sighs of relief. He throws her a shamefaced look
-- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made
the right play.
SELINA (cont.)
Besides -- I want this one for myself. So
pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new
face for Christmas.
The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on
the floor. He turns to FRICK and FRACK.
PENGUIN
Why don't you two tie up our host?
ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the
premises. FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back
parlor which opens off the room they're in.
INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone
cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands
and feet.
INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE
Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about
the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive
objects.
PENGUIN
It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it?
Just the sort of setting in which I've
always imagined myself.
ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of
disgust.
PENGUIN (cont.)
I see. You think I'm vulgar. You think
I'm...nouveau.
ALFRED
I think you're a dirty little man with
a --
The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a
tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES
crashing to the floor. He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK
reappear.
PENGUIN
See, boys, that's old money talking.
After a while, they actually start to
believe they've earned all this.
(smirking)
I don't mind. Someday I'll be old money
too -- when the statute of limitations
runs out.
SELINA (O.S.)
Hey! -- Guess what I just found.
Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see
SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of...
SELINA (cont.)
Christmas cookies!
The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from
cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet. SELINA
graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with
limited enthusiasm.
PENGUIN
Let's spread out and see what we can find.
(to FRICK and FRACK)
You two -- keep an eye on our friends
here. Give me a yell the minute Wayne
comes to.
FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front
parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through
the house. CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE --
-- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands
STRUGGLING against his bonds.
SERIES OF SHOTS
QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as
they search for the entrance to the cave. SELINA and the
PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for
secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE
APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out
of frames, etc.
Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the
grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the
parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on
ALFRED and VICKI.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT
CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a
LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels. Suddenly, an
ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and
fumbles for the lock --
INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring
from the kitchen. VICKI looks at ALFRED...
FRICK
Better check it out.
FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and
down a long hall to the kitchen. He tosses a glance back at
VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself.
FRICK (cont.)
What is it? What's going on??
VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor. DICK GRAYSON has
sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at
BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener. Both of them stiffen
simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a
clear view of DICK and BRUCE.
INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT
FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the
SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates. A RED LIGHT is
blinking, indicating DICK's break-in. FRACK throws switches
frantically, trying to kill the sound. Finally he succeeds --
and SHOUTS:
FRACK
Some kind of security system --
INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects
of the drug, isn't much use. He tries to get off the sofa and
crumples in a heap.
DICK
Can you move, man?
BRUCE
Library -- got to get me to the library --
DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door
opening onto the hallway. They're just about to step outside
when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen.
INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED
-- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch
the situation develop.
INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the
moment. By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway:
PENGUIN
What is that ungodly racket?
FRACK
A security alarm. It went off in the
kitchen.
PENGUIN
My God! Is someone in here?
He struts over to huddle with his cronies. BRUCE and DICK are
still poised in the doorway. It looks bad...
INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK
bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway. He pats VICKI's
knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat --
-- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun. A moment
of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time
to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and
vanish --
-- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for
long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor.
FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point-
blank range.
VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.
INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT
The room's a mess, books all over the floor. The groggy BRUCE
props himself up against his desk. He manages to pull the
bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret
switch. He's CRYING.
BRUCE
Alfred...
DICK
I'll go back.
BRUCE
I can't...get down there...without you.
DICK turns. To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is
swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE.
INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a
superficial wound to the arm. VICKI is on her knees beside
him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt.
PENGUIN
What an extraordinarily stupid thing to
do.
VICKI
SHUT UP. Help me with him.
The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give
VICKI a hand without him. They carry him into the parlor, lay
him out on the sofa. VICKI reaches into her purse for a
handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls
FRACK aside.
PENGUIN
You and I had better check the ground
floor and see what's going on. Mr. Frick
-- do you think you'll be able to manage
this pair?
FRICK
Yes sir.
PENGUIN
Oh, good. That does relieve my mind --
He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT
CORDS on the love seat. The blood drains out of his face.
PENGUIN (cont.)
Where's Wayne???
INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT
DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around
him in pure, unalloyed amazement. BRUCE is fumbling with a
packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of
pills and swallows them dry.
Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping
switches. They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind
BRUCE and looks on, dazzled.
INSERT - MONITOR
The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his
two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors.
PENGUIN
Check the grounds! The shape he's in, he
can't have gotten far.
BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE
He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and
waits.
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming
cautiously around the grounds. They turn suddenly --
-- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over
every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor!
INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT
The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside.
He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels
from outside. It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in
here...
INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER
DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne
Manor. BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down
below.
BRUCE
-- as soon as he gets to the East wing.
Wait for my signal. You know what to do.
DICK nods yes and bolts off.
INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER
VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint. With the
commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy-
fingered.
Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- ""SANTA
BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME."" FRICK turns and stares at it in
confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls --
-- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the
loudspeakers.
BRUCE (O.S.; filter)
VICKI! RUN! NOW!
She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall.
FRICK turns and takes aim --
-- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of
nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face! The shot goes wild and
the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it
over...
INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT
VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall. HUGE OAKEN SLIDING
DOORS are already slamming shut behind her. The same thing is
happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is
sealing itself off!
INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT
DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on
the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth. Before
FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the
back of the skull with a fireplace poker.
He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to
ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination
from the sofa.
DICK
Here. You might need it.
ALFRED
Thank you, Master Dick. And...bravo.
INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT
VICKI has made it to the wall phone. She can't seem to get a
dial tone --
VOICE FROM BEHIND
Do you really think we're that stupid?
VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is
SELINA's.
SELINA (cont.)
I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!
With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out. VICKI
turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before
she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around
her wrist, jerking the knife loose. SELINA tugs on the other
end, reeling her closer.
SELINA
You know, I've got a great recipe for
Sliced Bitch --
VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and
throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island. While
they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to
bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of
the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her
claws. VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to
block the blow: CLANG.
VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA
with knives and appliances. It buys her enough time to make
for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her. Another
downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK
into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in
the wood.
VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.
INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER
SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI.
SELINA
I love a good old-fashioned catfight --
but this is pissing me off.
VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED
COCKTAIL CART before her. It SLAMS full-force into SELINA,
who lands on her back on the great long dining table. VICKI
is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up.
INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER
VICKI races up the stairs. She has a good lead, but SELINA
makes up the difference in a hurry. She takes the stairway in
three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks
down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her
and LOCKING IT.
SELINA
HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty
kitty...
She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.
INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT
SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door
behind her. VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading
to a balcony, but it's too long a drop. She stands there
paralyzed as SELINA advances.
SELINA
So this is where you earn your keep.
She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves
her roughly back onto the bed. VICKI flails wildly as SELINA
kneels atop her...
SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly
section of bra --
SELINA
Mmm! Frederick's of Gotham?
She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT
DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's
belly. Now VICKI just loses it. She begins to SHRIEK
uncontrollably.
SELINA
Not so loud, honey! The neighbors'll get
the wrong idea.
(laughing)
Santa's coming. Time for all good girls
to go to sleep...
She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's
neck. But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes
wide-eyed and shuts up. A BLACK SHADOW falls across the
moonlit bed. SELINA tenses --
-- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair --
BATMAN
Miss me, ""Angel""?
He yanks her bodily off the bed. Before she knows what's
happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT. She flies into
the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges.
INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER
BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself
up.
SELINA
Okay -- let's do it, huh? You and me...
all the way this time.
She HISSES and jumps him. They grapple -- a quick flurry of
fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long
stairway.
She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner.
BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time...
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
VICKI rushes out of the bedroom. She looks down the hall and
sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN --
slamming into the wall opposite. He slumps to the carpet, out
cold.
A moment later DICK strolls out. VICKI rushes to his side --
VICKI
Come on. We'll be safe in the cave.
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER
BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is
slightly ajar. He pushes it in cautiously...
...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing
down mere inches from his face. It's the PENGUIN wielding the
ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him.
But then --
-- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing
on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again.
It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a
good workout in the next thirty seconds.
BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall
behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into
SELINA's ribs. It's a crippling blow; she flies backward,
knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES,
knocking over another -- and another --
-- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over,
domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the
cowering PENGUIN.
SELINA is badly hurt now. She makes it out of a rear door to
the armory. BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems
to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA.
SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around
enough to dig himself out.
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the
LIBRARY. VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a
bottom drawer. A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open...
INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT
As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to
DICK:
VICKI
Come on. Come with us.
DICK
No. I can still help...
INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER
The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of
the library and heads off in the opposite direction. There's
a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid.
WIPE TO:
INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER
At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are
VICKI and ALFRED. They pivot suddenly at the sound of a
VOICE:
PENGUIN
Such primitive entertainment.
He's holding a gun on the two of them. He stares about
delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave.
His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its
little plateau.
PENGUIN (cont.)
So Bruce equals Batman. It seems I've
discovered two treasures!
(an evil smile)
Don't move. I'd be only too happy to
shoot you both.
He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave.
He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of
the cavern. It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow
CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below.
PENGUIN
The Gotham City Treasury. It's about to
be stolen twice.
ALFRED
Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to
get it out of here.
PENGUIN
Oh, I'll manage somehow. You two are my
guarantee of that.
(nudging VICKI with the gun)
Let's have a look, shall we? You go
first.
He shoves her. She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her
head.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT
SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter-
speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes
down the hallway. She's just passed the balcony overlooking
the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path.
He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs
it in. She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.
SELINA
It could've been so nice -- you and me --
if only you weren't so screwed up.
BATMAN
It's over. I don't want to hurt you any
more.
SELINA
Tell me something -- one thing. If you
don't enjoy all this...why do you do it?
He just looks at her. He doesn't have an especially good
answer. She sighs.
SELINA (cont.)
I'll never understand men.
She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat.
As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the
narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall
floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the
enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling --
-- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up
a GUN from his belt. He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails
past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which
suspends the chandelier.
The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it --
and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry
hall. On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand
fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies
sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving.
BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs. Her arms and legs jut
out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering
YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat. He stands over her; she glares
up at him.
BATMAN
Nine lives.
CATWOMAN
I can't move. I can't move.
Her face is cut and bleeding. She tries to lift an arm and
can't quite manage it. He crouches down beside her, still
cautious...
CATWOMAN (cont.)
DON'T LOOK AT ME!!
(pleading)
Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I
want. Please?
BATMAN looks up. DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking
them, highly curious as to what he'll do.
BATMAN
No.
BATMAN slowly rises to his feet. She lets out another
gruesome WHINE.
CATWOMAN
COME ON. Don't stop now. FINISH ME OFF.
(almost weeping with pain)
Son of a bitch. You're all alike...
Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place. With an agonizing effort
she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist. She's trying to
slit her own throat.
He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and
breaks it open with his thumb. He drops it amid the shattered
glass around her face. A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out,
and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into
unconsciousness.
BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to
join him.
DICK
You should've done it, man. You should've
killed her.
BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing.
BATMAN
There's a radio in the cave. We'll send
for help.
INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER
The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK
FORMATION. A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk,
and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT. Now he has to follow; the
prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he
clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope.
They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK
FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the
catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.
PENGUIN
Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne. Look at
you now. Whatever would your friends say?
(smiling)
You've been an exceptionally congenial
host -- but I must ask you to back off.
The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they
climb the last few feet toward the grotto. BATMAN swings his
cape around, concealing his hands from view. He takes a
cautious step backward.
CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND
His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open.
ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI
They've pulled almost even with the rock formation. A LARGE
DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.
PENGUIN
No sudden moves. It's a long way down.
Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto...
HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO
A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all
these years. GLINTING in the darkness. Hanging upside-down,
above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them --
their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN...
He dislodges a rock. It tumbles into the grotto...
...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the
rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE.
ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI
He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him. He FIRES
HIS GUN wildly. The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they
come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM.
VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them
FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life.
BATMAN
VICKI!
An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG. Clean
hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down
across the rocks.
With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath
and VAULTS toward the CATWALK. She's a foot short; she grabs
hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to
pull herself up. BATMAN races toward her --
-- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky
outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN. The BATS
have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the
cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN.
THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first
shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward. As the second
spins him around. As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE
RAILING.
VICKI screams. BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand.
Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks
-- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip.
The ECHOES are cacophanous. ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the
vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly
projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor. And then --
BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS
IT. It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet. He stares
down at it, and two beats later --
-- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE. Within
moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON
THE SIGNAL. The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming. A CHOKED
WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands
there, PARALYZED.
He's just been beaten at his own game. He lets out a last
awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM --
-- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream
dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether...
BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk. He rushes
over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her
protectively. Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant
perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet. They embrace
on the edge of the abyss.
On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED. The
butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted,
clutching his wounded arm. DICK slings an arm around him and
helps him to the stairway.
CUT TO:
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT
SQUAD CARS everywhere. FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs,
flanked by COPS. PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious
SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an
ambulance.
INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
The place is an utter mess. Amid the carnage we find BRUCE
conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK. In b.g.,
a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound.
GORDON
...and then Batman showed up?
BRUCE
He saved all our lives, Jim. I can't say
for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind
the murders.
GORDON
God -- I pray you're right.
(beat)
One thing before we go, Bruce. Who's the
kid?
BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are
righting the fallen Christmas tree.
BRUCE
Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin. He's in
town for the holidays.
GORDON
Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit.
(turning to go)
Merry Christmas, Bruce. Good luck
cleaning this place up.
GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR.
BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front
parlor.
INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT
ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD. VICKI ambles up to
BRUCE:
VICKI
What are you going to do with all that
gold?
BRUCE
I dunno. Might be a good start on a place
to live -- for some people who don't have
one.
She hugs him. DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they
blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve.
VICKI
It's Christmas.
BRUCE
Yeah. Maybe you should -- open your
present.
She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly.
VICKI
Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter. None
of it matters. We're all safe. We're
together.
BRUCE
...You might as well.
He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT
BOX, which he hands to VICKI. She unwraps it, opens it slowly
-- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside.
She gazes up at him, speechless. He gazes back.
CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the
devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling
into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them;
ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace.
And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we
FADE OUT.
